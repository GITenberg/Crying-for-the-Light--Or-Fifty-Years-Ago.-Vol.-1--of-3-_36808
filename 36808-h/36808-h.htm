<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PARKER&rsquo;S PIECE,
SLOVILLE.</span></h2>
<p>Upon my word, I don&rsquo;t know a more desirable residence
from the pauper&rsquo;s point of view than Parker&rsquo;s Piece,
an awful spot in the very heart of the rising town of
Sloville.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say, as regards myself, that the
place has many attractions.&nbsp; It is too crowded, too dirty,
too evil-smelling, too much inhabited by living creatures,
including insects which delicacy forbids <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>mentioning.&nbsp; I like living in the country, where I
can hear the birds sing their morning anthem.&nbsp; I like to see
the buttercups and daisies, and the green grass, and the blue
sky, and the sunshine, which makes everyone feel happy; and when
winter comes, how much do I love the sparkling diamonds on the
frosted trees, and the pure white snow which robes the earth with
a loveliness of which the dweller in towns has no adequate
idea!&nbsp; I like to breathe fresh air, and not town smoke; and
so, individually, I had rather not reside in Parker&rsquo;s
Piece; but there are those who live there, and much enjoy
it.&nbsp; Mostly they are a ragged lot&mdash;tramps and vagrants
and the ever growing army of the unemployed&mdash;who make it
their headquarters, as it is full of old houses and corners where
the peelers cannot penetrate, and public-houses where the sot may
drink as long as his or her money lasts out; where, as regards
the spot in question, there is a special encouragement to do so,
seeing how much money was left ages ago by a <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>pious founder,
who had made money in some way which was not exactly right, and
who thought it just as well, when it was of no further use to
him, to leave it partly to the priests to pray for his soul, and
partly to the poor, that future generations might call him
blessed; and as the poor all round were well aware of the fact,
there was never a house or room that stood empty
long&mdash;unhealthy as was the place, and dilapidated as were
the buildings.</p>
<p>One building, however, was an exception to the others, as
regards age.&nbsp; Originally it had been started as a boot and
shoe manufactory, but that did not pay; then it became a depot
for pure literature and well-meant publications, but no one came
to buy; then it came into the hands of a Town Councillor, who,
disgusted that the Corporation would not purchase it at an
extravagant rate, to pull it down, vowed that he would never lay
out a penny on the place, only get out of it what rent he
could.&nbsp; As he let it out in tenements, the rents of which
were collected by a somewhat unscrupulous <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>agent, the fact
was, the locality became less respectable and less cared for
every day.&nbsp; It was avoided by the police as much as
possible.&nbsp; If there was a quarrel&mdash;as there was almost
every day&mdash;between its wretched inmates, it was hard to say
who was to blame.&nbsp; Passing down there one day, I saw a man
savagely assaulting his wife.&nbsp; To my remonstrance he replied
that if he did not let her know that he was master, she would
stick a knife into him; and, according to the public opinion of
the place, he was right.&nbsp; Only on Sunday morning was the
place quiet, and that was not because the dwellers there were at
church or chapel, but simply because the weary were enjoying an
extra hour&rsquo;s sleep, or the dissipated had not, as yet,
overcome the effect of the previous evening&rsquo;s debauch.</p>
<p>All at once Parker&rsquo;s Piece became known far and
near.&nbsp; One night a little one, happily, died, instead of
making a feeble and ineffectual struggle to live; an inquest was
held, and the result was a revelation of misery <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>and
wretchedness which made all Sloville stand aghast.&nbsp; A London
radical newspaper sent down an artist to give a rude drawing of
the place, and a special correspondent, whose report was as
sensational as could be desired.&nbsp; Parker&rsquo;s Piece
became as well known to the British community as the Mansion
House, or St. Paul&rsquo;s, or Westminster Abbey, or the Houses
of Parliament.&nbsp; Money showered down on the place, little to
the advantage of the deserving, who are the last to proclaim
their needs, but greatly to that of the publican and
sinner.&nbsp; It was felt by everybody something must be
done.&nbsp; A grand church was erected at one corner, to which,
however, no one went; a mission hall was started at the other by
a speculative philanthropist, on his own hook, while a building
was secured for a similar purpose by the leading people of the
leading Congregational Church in the town.&nbsp; It was a real
case of line upon line, and precept upon precept.&nbsp; The plan
was to catch sparrows by putting a little salt on their tails,
and the plan succeeded to admiration.&nbsp; <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>There was a
free tea, which was a great success; then there was a regular
breakfast on a Sunday morning, which answered still better.&nbsp;
The men looked rather sheepish at first, but the women were too
many for them.&nbsp; The fleshpots of Egypt prevailed, and there
was a good attendance, a state of resignation when the talking
began, and some awful singing afterwards.&nbsp; On the day of
which I write, there was a little extra excitement in the
place.&nbsp; Christmas was coming, and all the good people for
miles around had determined to give a treat to the wretched
ruffians in the very worst part of the place&mdash;the big
building to which I have already referred.&nbsp; When the leading
man of the place, Carroty Bill, heard it, he swore that there
should be no psalm-singing there.&nbsp; But his better-half
modified his rage as she drew a lovely picture of creature
comforts to be had&mdash;the boots for the children, the flannel
for herself, and the extra money they would have for a jolly
spree after all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I &rsquo;ave been to one of their
meetin&rsquo;s,&rsquo; said <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>she, &lsquo;and we &rsquo;ad a rare
good time of it, I can tell yer; tea, and coffee, such heaps of
bread-and-butter, and plum-cake, and great meat-pies; it was well
worth while a-settin&rsquo; an hour or two in a warm room while
the parsons were a-talkin&rsquo;; and rally you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo;
thought as how the ladies and gentlemen seemed to think as we
were brothers and sisters.&nbsp; We wos quite a &rsquo;appy
family, we wos.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then to be preached to,&rsquo; said Carroty Bill,
&lsquo;arterwards.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed if I&rsquo;ll
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take the children.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not Joe; yer can&rsquo;t take him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not? he ain&rsquo;t yer child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that, but I wants him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Carroty Bill kept his word; he had an idea of his own in his
thick head, and he was determined to carry it out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at that time there was a good deal of
antagonism between Church and Dissent.&nbsp; Generally, we know,
it is otherwise, and they love each other as <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>fellow-Christians ought&mdash;a love that does you good
to contemplate.&nbsp; As the Dissenters gave the feed, it
occurred to the Vicar and his curates to make a house-to-house
inspection&mdash;to see for themselves the nakedness of the land,
and to relieve it accordingly.&nbsp; At the bar of the White
Horse the new move was announced, and Carroty Bill, as he sat
smoking and drinking, hit on a plan of which he said nothing to
his female partner&mdash;for wife she never was&mdash;till the
time had come to carry it out.&nbsp; Said he, when he heard the
Vicar was to come:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, Joe, you come along with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I want to go with mother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You come along with me, or it will be the worse for
yer, I can tell yer,&rsquo; said Carroty Bill, with a look which
forbade all further thought of disobedience on the part of the
poor boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make the boy as bad as yerself,&rsquo;
said the woman, &lsquo;let him come along with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not if I know it,&rsquo; said the ruffian.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, wot&rsquo;s up?&rsquo; asked the woman.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s that to you?&nbsp; The boy must
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with a swelling heart, and a tear in his eye, the boy
went.&nbsp; He was filthy, and ragged, and half starved.&nbsp;
Yet there was something noble about the little lad&rsquo;s face;
had he been washed, and well dressed, and well fed, with his
curly hair and fine forehead and bright blue eyes, he would have
been as handsome a little fellow as was to be seen in the
town.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t lead him into mischief,&rsquo; said the
poor woman imploringly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In course not, my dear,&rsquo; said Carroty Bill
sarcastically: &lsquo;he&rsquo;s a gentleman, ain&rsquo;t he? and
he&rsquo;ll behave as such.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, turning to the
boy, who was still lingering by the woman&rsquo;s side, he said,
&lsquo;Come here, you little warmint, or I&rsquo;ll break every
bone in your body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This conversation was carried on at the White Horse, where the
speaker was mostly to be found.&nbsp; The woman gave way; the
speaker took the boy to Parker&rsquo;s Piece.&nbsp; Arrived
there, he sought out his own apartment, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and with the
help of the lad cleared it of everything it possessed in the
shape of chairs or clothes or table, leaving only a little straw,
on which the family were to lie.&nbsp; A dealer just by purchased
his household chattels for a song, about as much as they were
worth, and Carroty Bill had just time to get a drop at the White
Horse and return in an unwonted state of sobriety before the
Vicar and his curates entered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said the kind-hearted Vicar,
&lsquo;what wretchedness!&nbsp; How is it you are so badly
off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wife ill, and I got no work to do.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
very hard on a poor fellow like me,&rsquo; said our carroty
friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! it is indeed,&rsquo; said the Vicar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I little thought as I should have come to
this,&rsquo; said the man, in a desponding tone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; said the Vicar, &lsquo;perhaps we can
help you a little.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir, kindly,&rsquo; said the hardened
hypocrite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said the Vicar, &lsquo;what
wretchedness&mdash;<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>not a stick in the place!&nbsp; We must do something to
relieve this distressing case.&nbsp; What say you?&rsquo; said he
to his companions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, a pair of blankets and a hundredweight of coal at
the least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and a loaf of bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes! and a little warm clothing for the wife and
child in the corner.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a bright little
fellow,&rsquo; said he, pointing to Joe; &lsquo;is that your
eldest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir, he ain&rsquo;t one of ours,&rsquo; said the
woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;We keep him out of charity.&nbsp; His mother
is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said the Vicar; &lsquo;who would have
thought it?&nbsp; What true benevolence!&nbsp; How it does shame
us who are better off!&nbsp; How beautiful it is to see the poor
so ready to help one another!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! it is little we can do, but we allus tries to do
our duty,&rsquo; said Carroty Bill, with the look of a saint and
the courage of a martyr, while the forlorn woman seemed the
picture of resignation and despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure we might leave a little money here as
well,&rsquo; said the Vicar.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; said both the curates who
declared they had never seen more unmitigated poverty
anywhere.</p>
<p>And then they went off.</p>
<p>And thus relieved with a little ready cash and food, and
cheered with the prospect of blankets and coals and clothes, for
which tickets had been left, Carroty Bill was enabled at leisure
to rejoice over the effects of his artful dodge, which was told
to a crowd of applauding vagabonds, as rascally as himself; while
the landlord of the public, already referred to, could not find
too much to say on behalf of that Christian charity by which he
expected to benefit more than anyone else in that dingy and
poverty-stricken locality.&nbsp; The Vicar was quite justified so
far as appearances went.&nbsp; It was an unhealthy habitation
which he visited, and all the inmates looked sad and ill.</p>
<p>As the Vicar left the apartment of Carroty Bill he knocked at
the next door, inhabited by a hard-working shoemaker of
freethought tendencies, who hated him and all his ways.&nbsp; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>The Vicar
beat a hasty retreat, as he knew the sharpness of the
shoemaker&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want none of your cloth here,&rsquo;
said the disciple of St. Crispin.&nbsp; &lsquo;If there were a
God, should we be as wretched as we are?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is.&nbsp; I am His servant,&rsquo; said the
Vicar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You His servant?&nbsp; Why yer father bought yer the
living, and a nice living it is; you are yer father&rsquo;s
servant, not the Lord&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my good man&mdash;&rsquo; said the Vicar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t &ldquo;good man&rdquo; me,&rsquo; was the
angry reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we come for your good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what you all say; and I&rsquo;ll believe
it when I see you and the likes of you give up that part of the
tithes which was intended for the poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I come in the name of the Lord as His messenger,&rsquo;
said the Vicar in his most commanding tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Lord&rsquo;s receiver, I think,&rsquo; said the
shoemaker cynically, &lsquo;for you get all you can in His
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&lsquo;It is no use leaving anything here,&rsquo; said
the Vicar to his curates.</p>
<p>Nor was it.&nbsp; The shoemaker had been made an infidel, as
many are, by hard work and poor pay, by want of human sympathy,
by the greatness of his life-long sorrow.&nbsp; Wounded and
bruised and fallen among thieves, the Jew and the Levite had
passed by, and no Samaritan had come to his aid.&nbsp; The Gospel
of glad tidings has been preached for ages by the Churches,
chiefly to the rich and the respectable as they are called, and
the poor have been sent empty away.&nbsp; Christian ministers of
all denominations have hard work to do to make up for the
shortcomings of the past.</p>
<p>As the Vicar and his curates were leaving&mdash;and they were
anxious to get out into the fresh air, as the smell of the place
was awful&mdash;a door opened, and a thin and worn and weary
elderly woman entered, who had to earn her living by needlework,
and was one of the many to be met everywhere, who have seen
better days, and who, friendless and alone, have to die in a
garret, while the <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>rich thoughtlessly array themselves in purple and fine
linen and fare sumptuously every day.&nbsp; Surely there is
something amiss in our nineteenth-century civilization when such
is the case.&nbsp; It is well to tell such suffering ones that
there is a better world, and a Father in heaven who shall wipe
all tears from every eye, and where sorrow shall be
unknown.&nbsp; But surely our rich need not be so very rich nor
our poor so very poor, nor the cup of human suffering be, to
many, so overflowing.&nbsp; Surely we need not wait till we have
entered the golden gates and walked the pearly streets of the new
Jerusalem to set such matters right, or till the Saviour, as some
Christians tell us, comes to reign as a temporal Prince, in a
world He once blessed with His presence and brightened with His
smile.&nbsp; Human laws and misgovernment have had a good deal to
do with the appalling inequality which meets us on every side,
and which jars strongly with the Bible lessons read at our
churches on a Sunday and the utterances of our pulpit <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>orators.&nbsp; But let us return to the poor woman,
weary with hard work, with disappointed hope; weary of the bitter
past and of contemplating the dark future, on the black cloud of
which she could see, as she gazed at it steadily from year to
year, no silver lining.&nbsp; She makes no complaint, utters no
moan, is never visible in the streets; yet her lot is
hard&mdash;harder than she can bear&mdash;harder than that of the
improvident and thoughtless and vicious.&nbsp; All the sunshine
is gone out of her, and her heart is broken, though mechanically
she accomplishes her daily task.&nbsp; She had a husband, but he
died, and it was to give him decent burial that she had to part
with her little all; her son had been lost at sea; her daughter
had married, and had gone to live in a far-off colony, and a
voyage thither would kill her, as she had no stamina left in her
emaciated body.&nbsp; Look at her shrunken form, her pale cheeks,
her lacklustre eye, her hand worn to the bone!&nbsp; Her hold on
life is slender indeed.&nbsp; One of the silent ones is she, who
accept their <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>sorrow, and never speak of it as of a burden too heavy
to be borne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-morning, my friend,&rsquo; said the Vicar with a
benevolent smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have just been visiting your
poor neighbours and relieving their distress.&nbsp; They seem in
a very bad way&mdash;nothing in the house.&nbsp; It is sad to
think what would have become of them, if we had not called in the
very nick of time.&nbsp; It is really shocking, the amount of
misery in this unfortunate neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there is indeed a lot of it here,&rsquo; said the
poor woman.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is hard work to be happy
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you look as if you had employment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, I have, I am thankful to say, though it
brings me in but little; at any rate, I earn enough to keep me
off the parish.&nbsp; Perhaps, gentlemen, you would like to walk
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They did so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How neat! how clean!&rsquo; said the Vicar, as he
looked admiringly around.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a view you
have!&nbsp; Positively good; quite commands the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&lsquo;Yes, sir, but the chimneys give me a little more
smoke than I care for.&nbsp; It is rarely I dare open my window,
for fear of the blacks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, my good woman, it is so with all of us!&nbsp; There
is always something amiss&mdash;something we should like to get
rid of&mdash;a fly in the ointment,&rsquo; as Solomon says.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now, there are my curates: they are happy young men, but I
have no doubt they would like to be in my shoes&rsquo;&mdash;a
remark so true that the curates could not contradict it, only by
a deprecatory smile and shake of the head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear
me!&rsquo; continued the Vicar, as he turned from the window to
the interior.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you have a sofa here, with an
antimacassar!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon, sir, that is my bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well, it is quite a model&mdash;quite a
model.&nbsp; Why, we could dine here off the floor.&nbsp; What a
nice little bit of carpet!&nbsp; What a nice little
looking-glass!&nbsp; Oh, woman, how strong is the ruling
passion!&nbsp; And bless me!&rsquo; he said, turning, as he made
a still longer inspection, &lsquo;why, here are <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>flowers&mdash;positively flowers&mdash;and flowers cost
a deal of money at this season of the year!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me, sir, they are artificial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! ah, yes, I see they are; but artificial flowers
cost money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They cost me but very little.&nbsp; I made them myself,
to sell, if possible, but I could not get a customer, and so I
kept them to make the room a bit cheerful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I see you are one of the better class of
workpeople&mdash;what I may call the aristocracy.&nbsp; I am
awfully sorry.&nbsp; I should really have liked to have helped
you, but our funds are small, and the amount of distress in the
town is so large that we are obliged to be very
particular&mdash;very particular indeed.&nbsp; It is a duty we
owe to the parish and to the kind friends who have subscribed the
money.&nbsp; They have the greatest confidence in us, and we must
not abuse that confidence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, sir, don&rsquo;t think of it.&nbsp; If there are
any poor people much worse off than myself, why, I pity
&rsquo;em,&rsquo; said the poor woman.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&lsquo;Worse off, my good woman!&nbsp; Oh, the town is
full of such!&nbsp; Look at your poor neighbours in the next
room&mdash;a most shocking case; yet, in all their poverty,
taking charge of a little waif that, somehow or other, came into
their hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman said nothing.&nbsp; She could have said a good deal,
but she knew the family, and she also knew the value of peace and
quietness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you will like to accept of this little
tract,&rsquo; said the Vicar, who wished to show his sympathy,
but who did not exactly know how.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is prettily got
up, and I rejoice to say it has been found greatly useful.&nbsp;
You will, perhaps, read it with more interest as it was written
by myself.&nbsp; And here is another, by my daughter, &ldquo;On
the Blessings of Poverty.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On what, sir?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;On the Blessings of Poverty.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I never heard of them.&nbsp; I am sure I shall
like to read that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here they are, then,&rsquo; said the Vicar, handing
them smilingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;And now we <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>must wish you
good-morning; our time is precious, and we have a good deal to do
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you better not give her something to eat?&rsquo;
said one of the curates in a low voice as they were turning
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh dear no!&rsquo; said the Vicar; &lsquo;that would be
very wrong&mdash;very wrong indeed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then in an
undervoice he added: &lsquo;Our intrusion here is quite a
mistake.&nbsp; This is not a case in which we can
interfere.&nbsp; But we wish you a good-morning, with the
compliments of the season; and I will get my daughter to call
with a few more tracts, and perhaps she might like to buy some of
your artificial flowers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I should be glad to see her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, we shall see.&nbsp; You know me, of course;
I am the Vicar of the parish.&nbsp; Of course, you have often
seen me at church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say that I have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say you don&rsquo;t go to
a place of worship?&nbsp; You are not a heathen, are
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&lsquo;I hope not, sir; but I have to work so hard all
the week that I am thankful for a little more rest on a Sunday,
and when I go out I go to chapel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To chapel!&nbsp; How is that?&rsquo; said the Vicar, in
a by no means pleased tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know all
Dissenters are schismatics?&nbsp; My good woman, I am sorry for
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, I go to chapel because I was brought up to
it, and it seems more homelike.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, the chapel people must look after
you.&nbsp; You are not in my charge at all.&nbsp; It is a pity,
and I am sorry for it.&nbsp; Perhaps, if we saw you at church we
could help you a little, if ever you did require any aid.&nbsp;
But we can&rsquo;t discuss that question.&nbsp; It is clear we
have no further business here, have we, Mr. Jones?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The curate with that uncommon name replied to his reverend
superior, &lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied the poor woman, with a
shade of disappointment over her <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>pale face, and a little more of
pardonable acidity in her tone; &lsquo;certainly not.&nbsp; I am
no beggar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so, my good woman,&rsquo; said the Vicar, as he
tripped with his curate downstairs.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just so; as I
have said, we have to exercise the utmost care in the disposal of
our funds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>More of a Samaritan than the Vicar, the poor woman kept the
door open till she had heard the last of his steps down the
creaking stairs, or he might have had a fall, a not uncommon
circumstance on that dilapidated staircase, and then she turned
away to her loneliness and misery with her broken heart.&nbsp;
The lamp flickered in the socket, the end was very near; life for
her had no charm, death no terror.</p>
<p>That night was one of extra jollity as far as the inhabitants
of Parker&rsquo;s Piece were concerned.&nbsp; The police had not
had so much trouble in the place for a long while, nor had the
publicans and pawnbrokers done such a roaring trade.&nbsp; No one
couple in all that squalid district was more drunk <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>that night
than Carroty Bill and his better-half.</p>
<p>That night was one of intense cold&mdash;the coldest, in feet,
of the year, the coldest of many years&mdash;and, as such, noted
by distinguished meteorologists.&nbsp; The cold was everywhere;
in the palace of the prince, as well as in the hut of the
peasant.&nbsp; It crept into Belgravian homes, where the lord and
master lined himself with extra good cheer, and warmed himself
with extra fires; it made dainty maidens and high-born matrons
wrap themselves in extra fur as they drove home from dinner-party
or theatre, or concert or ball.&nbsp; In railway carriages there
was an extra demand for foot-warmers, and at every refreshment
bar there was an incessant demand for a glass of something
hot.&nbsp; It was the same in all the publics and gin-palaces;
and it was a curious fact, the poorer the people were, the more
eager was their consumption of potent fluids; and how they
lingered around the places where they were sold, even when their
money and their credit were gone, as if loath <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to do battle
with the cold without as it pinched their gloveless hands or
shoeless feet, or as it found its way into their cheerless garret
or cellar as the case might be!&nbsp; In the homes of the
well-to-do how the fires blazed, as the fond mother clasped
tightly her babe to her bosom for further warmth.&nbsp; In some
of the best constructed conservatories the frost nipped off many
a tender plant, and as costly as tender, while out-door gardeners
suffered losses bewailed bitterly for many a long year.&nbsp;
There were muscular young Christians who enjoyed that cold
amazingly, as, well fed and well clad, bearing torches, they
skated along the Serpentine, or in Regent&rsquo;s Park, and
laughed hugely when any of their weaker brethren or sisters
complained.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, the night&rsquo;s frost
played sad havoc with the old, the feeble, and the tender.&nbsp;
It crept into that attic in Parker&rsquo;s Piece, where that poor
needlewoman lived.&nbsp; There was no fire in her empty grate to
keep it out, no extra blanket for her bed, no vital warmth in her
attenuated frame to withstand its <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>fatal power; and when the early
sunbeams made their way through the frosted window with
difficulty, they lit up, not the pale face of a living woman, but
of a corpse.&nbsp; She had been sorely tried that day.&nbsp; The
last straw had broken the camel&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; Christian
charity&mdash;while it relieved the undeserving, while it had
feasted the reprobate&mdash;had passed by her, because, poor as
she was, she was a real woman with all a woman&rsquo;s
self-respect and sensitiveness to shame, not a drunken,
dissipated wretch of brazen face and fluent tongue.&nbsp; Her
heart was broken already, and she fell an easy prey to the cold
as it stiffened her withered limbs and stopped her poor
heart&rsquo;s action and dried up the feeble current of her
blood.&nbsp; Again the coroner came to Parker&rsquo;s Piece, and
an intelligent jury returned a verdict of &lsquo;Death from the
visitation of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dear reader, you and I know
better; she was murdered, and a day will come when some one will
have to suffer for that deed&mdash;murdered she was, as surely as
if her throat had been cut by the assassin&rsquo;s knife.&nbsp;
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>There are
thousands in this land of churches and chapels and abounding
charities who die in this way every year, and someone, statesman,
or parson, or philanthropist, or master, or neighbour, is to
blame.&nbsp; As regards each of us, it is as well that we pray
with David, &lsquo;Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God of my
salvation.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is only as we realize the spirit of
that prayer that we can save the perishing.&nbsp; That is the
remedy, and not the dream of the Utopian, or the Socialist, or
the mad result of anarchy and crime.</p>

28</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ACTRESS AND THE WAIF.</span></h2>
<p>A lady&mdash;a genius, beautiful in face, well formed in
person, one of Nature&rsquo;s nobility if of doubtful
pedigree&mdash;had been giving a Shakespearian reading or
recitation, it matters not which, to a highly respectable
audience in a highly respectable county town.&nbsp; The leading
county families had, as they were bound to do, put in an
appearance on the occasion.&nbsp; Wealthy manufacturers, who did
not much care about that sort of thing themselves, had sent their
women-folk, always delighted to show that they could dress as
well, and look as grand, as the wives and daughters of men whose
ancestors had fought at Agincourt or at the Battle of
Hastings.&nbsp; Bevies of sweet girl <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>graduates, from the neighbouring
female academies, had come to listen and admire; while a few of
the superior class of tradesmen and local magnates had kindly
condescended to patronize the star that had suddenly appeared in
their midst, and whose portrait for some weeks previous had
ornamented their walls and shop windows&mdash;in the case of the
latter by means of photographs, while big lithographs were
available for posters.&nbsp; The audience were deeply affected,
some with the loveliness of the actress, others, a more select
and elderly party, with her dramatic power.&nbsp; According to
local journals, the actress was greeted with an ovation as she
resumed her seat.&nbsp; All eyes were turned on her as she
retired from the scene of her triumphs, fevered with excitement,
wearied with her physical exertion, flushed with the applause she
had honestly won, her brain still reeking with excitement, her
whole figure quivering with emotion, her eyes still glistening
with the light that never shone on sea or shore.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>By the
side of the public hall was a small committee-room, into which
our heroine was led, having previously effected a change in her
dress and put on her bonnet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How far is it to the railway-station?&rsquo; she asked
of the committee who had managed the undertaking, and who, as the
model men of the town, embalmed or embodied in themselves all
those superior virtues which we invariably associate with
respectability and wealth, as they stood in a semicircle round
her chair, timidly and admiringly&mdash;timidly, for they were
all respectable married men and had characters to lose;
admiringly, because for two hours the actress, by her magic art,
had opened up to them something greater and grander than even the
busy life of Sloville town itself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How far is it to the railway-station?&rsquo; repeated
the Mayor, with an anxious and troubled visage, as if such a
question had never been put to him before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A carriage will take you there in less <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>than ten
minutes,&rsquo; said the Town Clerk, rushing, as he was bound to
do, to the relief of the august head of the Corporation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mare will take you there in five minutes,&rsquo;
said the old church Vicar, not willing to hide his light under a
bushel, and at the same time glad to say a good word for the
animal in question.&nbsp; His reverence, it is to be feared, was
not much of a theologian, but there were two things which
everyone admitted he did understand, and they were&mdash;horses
and wine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brougham is quite at your service,&rsquo; said the
Mayor, who was of the party, and who began to fear that unless he
asserted himself he would be left out in the cold altogether.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, gentlemen, but I&rsquo;d rather walk,&rsquo;
said the actress.</p>
<p>She had passed her childhood in that town, and she was anxious
to see what alterations had been made by Time&rsquo;s effacing
fingers since she had last looked wistfully at its shop-windows,
or with girlish glee had walked its streets.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>&lsquo;Walk!&rsquo; all exclaimed, in a tone which
intimated not a little surprise at the absurdity of the idea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; repeated the lady calmly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d
rather walk.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? there is plenty of
time, and the weather is beautiful.&nbsp; I really should enjoy
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, madam,&rsquo; said the Mayor, &lsquo;if you
insist upon it, of course we cannot be so rude as to prevent
it.&nbsp; I think I may also say, on behalf of the Corpo&mdash;I
beg pardon, on behalf of the committee, that if you do walk we
shall all be delighted to accompany you to the
railway-station.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so say all of us,&rsquo; said the Town Clerk,
blushing as soon as he finished, fearing that the levity of his
speech might not be acceptable to the Vicar.&nbsp; He was,
however, delighted to find his remark received with universal
assent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re very kind,&rsquo; said the lady; &lsquo;I
am sorry to give you so much trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No trouble at all, madam,&rsquo; was, of course, the
polite reply of the whole party.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will take a little refreshment before <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>you
go?&rsquo; said the Mayor.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me offer you a glass
of wine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I thank you, I&rsquo;d rather not.&nbsp; I am a
teetotaler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rsquo; said the Mayor, who
was a brewer, and who had ridden into place and power by means of
his barrels; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t think a glass of wine wicked,
I hope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so absurd as all
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such an exciting life as yours must really require a
little stimulus; let me give you half a glass,&rsquo; said the
Vicar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a drop, thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you have taken the pledge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; said the lady, laughing; &lsquo;I am not
so bad as to require that.&nbsp; I am never tempted to
drink.&nbsp; If I thought it would do me any good, I would take a
glass of wine; but I find I am better without it, and so I
don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, then, will you take?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cup of tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cup of tea&mdash;how provoking!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>about the
only thing we can&rsquo;t give you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I will put up with a glass of water and a
sandwich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Mayor was shocked; he had never heard such a request from
a lady before.&nbsp; In his distress he appealed to the Vicar for
aid.&nbsp; His reverence was equal to the occasion, actually
going so far as to quote St. Paul, and to tell how he recommended
Timothy to take a glass of wine for his stomach&rsquo;s sake and
his often infirmities.&nbsp; His reverence did more: he enforced
his argument by example, taking a glass himself, and at the same
time recommending the rest of the committee to do the same.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fine port that,&rsquo; said he, smacking his lips and
holding up the glass to the light to see the beeswing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Mayor; &lsquo;it was a present to
the Corporation from Sir Watkin Strahan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lady coloured as she heard the name.&nbsp; It was observed
by the committee, whose inferences were not of the most
charitable <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>construction.&nbsp; Everyone knew that Sir Watkin was
rather fast, and was supposed to have great weaknesses as far as
actresses were concerned.&nbsp; The situation was becoming
embarrassing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had we not better be moving?&rsquo; asked the lady,
rising from her seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Mayor, &lsquo;if we start at
once, we shall get to the station in ample time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The procession was then formed, the Mayor and the lady walking
first, the Vicar and the Town Clerk bringing up the rear.&nbsp;
Only one of the committee had gone home.&nbsp; He was new to his
office; he had made a lot of money in the shoe trade, and had
recently retired from business, and was rather doubtful as to the
propriety of being seen by daylight walking with an actress in
the streets.</p>
<p>On they went.&nbsp; The general public, consisting of
school-boys out of school, and of the usual loafers who stand
idle all the day long in the market-place, or at the corners of
public-houses and livery stables, were not a little shocked as
the actress from the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Royal Theatre, Covent Garden, walked
along the streets as an ordinary Mrs. Jones or Brown might have
done.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I would &rsquo;ave &rsquo;ad a cab, at any
rate,&rsquo; said the ostler of the leading hotel in the town, as
the party passed, a remark cordially accepted by his hearers, a
seedy and bloated set of horsey-looking men, who seemed to have
nothing particular to do, and took a long time to do it in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ow the dickens are fellows like me to get a
livin&rsquo; if tip-top actresses like that &rsquo;ere young
ooman take to walkin&rsquo;?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wot I call
downright mean.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been &rsquo;ere and took a lot
of money out o&rsquo; the town, and han&rsquo;t spent a blessed
bob on a cab.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here the speaker, overcome with
emotion, dived into the pockets of his ragged corduroys, and
finding unexpectedly there the price of a pot of beer, repaired
to the neighbouring bar, there to solve the question he had
anxiously asked; or to forget it, as he took long draughts of his
favourite beverage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the actress and her attendant guardian angels
continued walking, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>she rapidly striving to recollect old shops and old
faces, whilst they mechanically uttered the unmeaning nothings
that at times&mdash;and the present was one of them&mdash;are
quite as acceptable as real talk.&nbsp; As if by magic, the news
spread that the actress was walking to the station, and great was
the joy of the young men who served in all the fine shops in the
market-place, who had never seen a real live actress from London
in the daytime before, and whose remarks were of a highly
complimentary order.&nbsp; The shop-girls, who stared, were
equally excited, but perhaps a little more disposed to be
critical.&nbsp; Further from the town centre the excitement was
less evident.&nbsp; People in the genteel villas scarce deigned
to turn their heads.&nbsp; To be emotionless and self-possessed
is the object of gentility all the world over.&nbsp; People in
genteel villas are not easily excited.&nbsp; In the low
neighbourhood nearer the station, inhabited by guards and porters
and stokers and signalmen, where engines are perpetually
whistling and screaming and letting off steam, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>there was no
excitement at all.&nbsp; In such places, during business hours,
one has something to think of besides actors and actresses, and
so the station yard was very quickly gained.&nbsp; Only were to
be seen a few young swells of the town, who turned very red if
the actress looked their way, simply gazing respectfully from
afar, wishing that they had been walking with the actress instead
of the Town Clerk, the Vicar, or the Mayor.&nbsp; The latter
worthy was a little proud of his position.&nbsp; He had by his
side and under his protection one whom he remarked, aside to his
friends, was not only an actress, but a deuced fine woman.&nbsp;
The influence of a fine woman on the male mind, especially in the
provinces, where overpowering female beauty is scarce, is
marvellous.&nbsp; Even the reverend Vicar was not insensible to
its fascination; while the Town Clerk, who was a bachelor, was,
therefore, very legitimately in the seventh heaven, wherever that
may be; and when Sir Watkin Strahan&rsquo;s family coach, with
the three old maids of that old family, drove up, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>those
excellently disposed ladies, to whom all Sloville was in the
habit of grovelling, for the first time in their lives almost
found themselves slighted, though as to what there was
extraordinary to look at in that actor-woman from London they
could none of them see.</p>
<p>Suddenly the aspect of affairs was changed.</p>
<p>Just outside the railway-station, on the bare earth,
sweltering in the summer sun, was a bundle of rags.&nbsp; The
actress was the first to perceive it</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; she exclaimed,</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bundle of rags,&rsquo; said one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of very dirty ones too,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;it is a
living child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A child!&nbsp; Impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I tell you it is, and we must save it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actress led the way to the bundle of rags.&nbsp; They were
the only clothes of a little lad who, hatless and shoeless and <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>shirtless,
was lying on the ground&mdash;to be trampled on by horses or men,
it seemed to matter little to him.&nbsp; To him approached the
awfulness of respectability as embodied in the persons of the
Mayor and the Vicar, but he never moved; he was too tired, too
weak, too ill to rise.&nbsp; Half awake and half asleep there he
lay, quite unconscious, as they looked in his face&mdash;thin
with want, grimy with dirt, shaded with brown curling hair.&nbsp;
Presently the lad got upon his legs with a view to running
away&mdash;that&rsquo;s the invariable etiquette on the part of
ragged boys in such cases&mdash;but it was too late.&nbsp;
Already the enemy were on him.&nbsp; Holding his right hand
across his brow so as to shade his eyes, he plucked up his
courage and prepared for the encounter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hulloa, you little ragamuffin, what are you up to
here?&rsquo; said the Mayor, in a tone which frightened the poor
boy at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t speak so, Mr. Mayor,&rsquo; said the
actress; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll frighten the poor boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear madam,&rsquo; said the august official,
&lsquo;what are we to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>&lsquo;Save the child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s easier said than done.&nbsp; Besides,
what is the use of saving one?&nbsp; There are hundreds of such
lads in Sloville, and we can&rsquo;t save &rsquo;em
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite true,&rsquo; said the Vicar, professionally
shaking his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my poor boy?&rsquo; said the
actress, as, heedless of the remarks of her companions, she
stooped down to kindly pat the head of the little waif, who was
at first too frightened to reply.</p>
<p>Slowly and reluctantly he opened his big blue eyes and stared,
then he screwed up his mouth and began to cry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, my little man,&rsquo; continued the actress, in
her gentlest tone, &lsquo;tell us what is the matter with
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, tell the good lady what&rsquo;s the matter with
you!&rsquo; said the Vicar, who thought it was now high time for
him to say something.</p>
<p>Even then the boy sulked.&nbsp; He was of a class apparently
for whom respectability has few kind words or looks, who, in this
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>wicked
world, get more kicks than half-pence.&nbsp; Respectability has
quite enough to do to look after her own children, especially now
that taxes and butchers&rsquo; bills and School Board rates, to
say nothing of coals, run up to such formidable items, to give
herself much trouble about the children of other people.&nbsp; I
have myself little pity for the heartless vagabonds who bring
children into existence merely that they may rot and die.&nbsp;
Of the devilish cruelty of such fathers and mothers no tongue can
give an adequate idea; hanging is too good for them.&nbsp; It is
to them we owe the pauperism which, apparently, it is beyond the
power of the State to cure.&nbsp; I am sick of the cant ever
uttered of population <i>versus</i> property; one is born of
self-denial, industry, foresight, all the qualities which we as a
nation require, while population is too often the result of
unspeakable vice or consummate folly, qualities against which it
becomes the nation to set its face.</p>
<p>But I must not forget the actress.&nbsp; More tenderly and
coaxingly she repeated the <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>question.&nbsp; To the charm of that
voice and manner resistance was impossible.</p>
<p>Swallowing the rising tear with a great effort, slowly opening
his eyes and mouth at the same time, and looking terribly
frightened all the while, the poor lad replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;ve got such a pain in my
head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you&rsquo;ve got a headache, lying like that
in the sun.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you get away and run
home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t got a home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, what are you doing here?&rsquo; said the
Mayor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it seems,&rsquo; said the Vicar.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your father?&rsquo; asked the
actress,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t got one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, where&rsquo;s your mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gone off with a tramp, and she took brother with
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why did not she take you as well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Cause she said I was big enough to earn my own
wittles and drink.&nbsp; But I <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>must be off; here comes a
bobby,&rsquo; said the boy, frightened at the appearance of one
of the town police.&nbsp; Alas! he was too weak to run; he had
had no food all day, and his only bed by night had been under
some old waggon or in some old barn or loft, and, barefooted, he
fell an easy prey to the representative of law and order.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, you young rascal,&rsquo; said the policeman, as he
gave the lad a good shaking, apparently in order to test the
strength of his ragged clothes, and, if possible, to make matters
worse, &lsquo;get out of this, and be off,&rsquo; an order which
the poor lad would have obeyed had not the actress held his
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know him,&rsquo; said she to the policeman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Know him! of course I do.&nbsp; It was only last week I
had him up before the magistrate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For sleeping in the open air, and now here he is
again.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis very aggrawatin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the use of trying to do one&rsquo;s duty if this
sort of thing goes on?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>&lsquo;Is it a crime to sleep in the open air?&rsquo;
asked the actress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you see, ma&rsquo;am, it ain&rsquo;t allowed by
the magistrates; leastwise, not inside the borough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor little fellow!&rsquo; said the actress as she
looked at the lad; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take him myself to the
workhouse.&nbsp; There he would be out of harm&rsquo;s way, and
washed and fed, and made clean and comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am, that ain&rsquo;t no
use; you ain&rsquo;t got a horder, and it is as much as the
porter&rsquo;s place is worth to take anyone in without a
horder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, what&rsquo;s to be done with the poor
boy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the question,&rsquo; said the
policeman, and he was right there.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s to be done
with our boys, rich or poor, good or bad, is a question some of
us find increasingly hard to answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you can&rsquo;t help me?&rsquo; said the
actress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, mum; we&rsquo;ve plenty of such boys
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; said the lady she
still looked at the poor boy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it right to leave
him thus?&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a tear in her voice as she
spoke.&nbsp; All seemed so hard and unmoved, and the urgency was
so pressing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear madam,&rsquo; said the Mayor, who felt himself
bound to say something, &lsquo;the case is a hard one, but
there&rsquo;s no help for it.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t encourage such
hoys as that.&nbsp; If we did, the town would be overrun with
them.&nbsp; They are always begging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t beggin&rsquo;,&rsquo; said the boy, who
now began to feel interested in the discussion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to go beggin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I want a
job.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, all the boys say that,&rsquo; said the Vicar,
&lsquo;the young rascals!&nbsp; If I had my way, I would give
them a good whipping all round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, and if we listened to all these stories the bench
would have to sit all day long,&rsquo; said the Town Clerk,
giving the boy a copper and ordering him off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Off,&rsquo; said the actress&mdash;&lsquo;where
to?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&lsquo;To Parker&rsquo;s Buildings,&rsquo; said the
Mayor.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s where these young rascals
live.&nbsp; There is not a worse place in the whole
town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor in the country nayther,&rsquo; said the
policeman.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be a good job if the whole place
were burnt down.&rsquo;&nbsp; The policeman always backed up the
opinions of his worship the Mayor, as, indeed, he did those of
all his betters.&nbsp; It was a habit that paid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the poor boy looks really ill; can&rsquo;t you
get him into the hospital?&rsquo; asked the actress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; said the Vicar, &lsquo;but the
committee of the hospital don&rsquo;t meet for a week, and we can
do nothing in such a case.&nbsp; If it had been winter we could
have sent him to the soup-kitchen; but in the summer-time we are
not prepared for such an irregularity.&rsquo;&nbsp; At length a
happy thought struck him.&nbsp; Turning to the boy, he said,
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, my little man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little Beast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little Beast!&nbsp; Good heavens! what a <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>name for a
child.&nbsp; Who gave you that name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother.&nbsp; Mother allus calls me Little Beast,
&rsquo;cause I won&rsquo;t let her hit brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The boy spoke honestly, that was clear.&nbsp; There was some
good in him; the devil had not yet got him in his grip.&nbsp; Was
he to be saved?&nbsp; The Mayor, and the Town Clerk and the Vicar
seemed inclined to answer that question in the negative.&nbsp; A
passage of Scripture&mdash;a word of the
Master&rsquo;s&mdash;came into the actress&rsquo;s recollection
as she looked at the little waif, ragged, half starved, filthy,
in their midst.&nbsp; Said the Master, when His disciples asked
Him which should be greatest in the kingdom of heaven, taking a
little child and setting him in their midst, &lsquo;Except ye be
converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter the
kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; Whosoever, therefore, shall humble
himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom
of heaven, and whoso receiveth one such child in My name
receiveth Me.&nbsp; Take heed that ye despise not one of these
little ones, for I say unto <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>you that in heaven their angels do
always behold the face of My Father which is in
heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Save the child,&rsquo; whispered the woman&rsquo;s
heart of the actress; &lsquo;to-morrow it will be too late, and
human law, with all its terrors, will track him, and he will be a
rebel against man and God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse me,&rsquo; said the Mayor, &lsquo;but the train
has been signalled, and will be in in a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am ready,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;but the child
goes with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The child seemed to nestle under her
wing, as it were.&nbsp; He was frightened by the others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is
impossible!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What an idea!&rsquo; were the
respective utterances of Mayor, Vicar, and Town Clerk, who
simultaneously stepped back a step or two, as if doubting whether
the lady were in full possession of her senses and were desirous
to settle that question by a fuller survey a little further
off.&nbsp; It is astonishing how great a sensation is produced in
this Christian country when anyone tries to <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>reduce
Christianity to practice, to get it to talk modern English, to
bring it down from the clouds, and to make it walk the
streets.&nbsp; Just then the station bell rang.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my little man, won&rsquo;t you come along with
me?&rsquo; said the actress to the lad.&nbsp; The little fellow
opened his eyes&mdash;they were fine ones, and testified to the
beating of a clear, undefiled, honest heart within&mdash;and
joyfully assented.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please get him a glass of milk, and some sandwiches and
biscuits; put them on a tray,&rsquo; said the actress to the
stolidly staring policeman, who was so overcome that, quite
unconsciously, he found himself holding the ragged boy by the
hand, and administering to him what little refreshment there was
to take, and putting him in a first-class carriage, having first
carefully covered him over with one of the actress&rsquo;s
shawl&rsquo;s, that the shame of his nakedness might not appear,
as if he were a young nobleman&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are rum critters, them actresses,&rsquo; <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>said the
policeman on recovering his dazed senses, as the train moved off,
leaving the local dignitaries rather crestfallen, as they stood
on the platform bidding adieux with their hats in their hands,
and their uncovered, bald heads glistening in the summer sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are indeed, Jenkins,&rsquo; said the Mayor, wiping
his hot face with his pocket-handkerchief, evidently pleased that
the actress had gone and relieved the town of one juvenile
difficulty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate, to whom does this boy belong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, to Widow Brown, who is off on the tramp; but I
don&rsquo;t believe it is her boy, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely not; but we are well rid of the lad and his
mother, I think I know her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you do.&nbsp; There has been scarcely a
Monday all this summer but she has been brought up as drunk and
disorderly.&nbsp; I believe she is perfectly incorrigible; and
yet she was a tidy, decent sort of woman <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>when she
first came to live here,&rsquo; said the Town Clerk.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She took to drinking when her husband died, and she has
been going from bad to worse ever since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ah, when one is low, and wants to forget one&rsquo;s
wickedness, and poverty, and misery, there&rsquo;s nothing like a
drop of drink.&nbsp; It may be rather cowardly to take it, but we
are not all heroes; and as long as the drink lasts, you are in a
world of sunshine and good fellowship.&nbsp; There is a magic
power in drink to make the old young, the sick whole, the poor
rich.&nbsp; No wonder the homeless and destitute take to
it.&nbsp; Till the people are better lodged and better fed,
intemperance must be the curse of Great Britain.</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GOING UP TO TOWN.</span></h2>
<p>In these degenerate days a first-class carriage in an express
may be considered as the perfection of travelling, the balloon at
present being unmanageable, and the sea as wilful and variable as
woman.&nbsp; Time was when we rattled cheerily over the land on
the top of a coach-and-four, but that was when men drank
brandy-and-water, and wore many-caped coats, and were far more
horsey than this smug and mild black-coated generation.&nbsp;
Rarely now does the scarlet-clad guard tootle the much-resounding
horn as the four corn-fed steeds trot steadily up hill and down,
wakening the far-away echoes, while open-mouthed rustics stop and
stare, and rosy-cheeked landladies <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>smile wickedly at the jovial
outsiders, who, not having the fear of their own lawful-wedded
wives before their eyes, seem to regard their day&rsquo;s journey
as a frolic, as, indeed, it was in the good old coaching days,
when the driver, an inborn aristocrat, was hail-fellow-well-met
with all on his bit of road, and when every passenger had his
story to tell or his joke, which, if not brilliant, at any rate
helped to pass the time away, and to keep everyone in good
humour.&nbsp; What a time that was, for instance, at Barnet, when
the town was kept alive night and day, as coach after coach came
up at full gallop, changed horses at the Red Lion or the
Salisbury Arms in the twinkling of an eye, and then made its way
on to the great Metropolis, or away to the big cities of the
North, with such telling news as that Queen Caroline was dead, or
that the Lords had thrown out Reform!&nbsp; It was merry England
then, and no mistake; pure air filled the lungs, and sylvan
beauty fed the eye, and the further he travelled the better was
the traveller in health and spirits.&nbsp; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>I am not
surprised that Mr. Carnegie, the great American capitalist, in
order to give his friends an idea of England, and thoroughly to
enjoy himself, packed them all on the top of a four-horse coach,
and I can well believe that they saw a loveliness in this old
land of ours as they drove past ancient castles and ivy-clad
churches, and by the side of well-kept parks, with the mansions
of our nobles peeping in and out among the trees, and through
smiling villages and busy towns, and across wide commons scented
with yellow furze or purple with heather, which they could have
acquired in no other way.&nbsp; Boxed up in a railway carriage,
the roar of the train deafening your ears, and the smoke and the
steam of the engine intercepting the view, what can you do but
groan over the memory of departed joys?&nbsp; But I must return
to Sloville, which, like every other town of its size, has its
railway, with its average number of accidents.&nbsp; In a very
few minutes the little country town was left behind, in a very
few minutes the actress and the boy <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>began to look at one another, and by
the time he had eaten up his sandwiches and biscuits he began to
feel quite at home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not frightened?&rsquo; said the actress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, not a bit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He could not well be, with so fair a face opposite his
own.&nbsp; Presently he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t this jolly! a deal better than going on the
tramp!&nbsp; The old man and mother are allus on the
tramp.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you have no home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Home!&nbsp; What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I see you haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the lady, with
a sigh, &lsquo;or you would not have asked me that
question.&nbsp; Can you read?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&nbsp; Anything to
eat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actress took out a newspaper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, what does that mean?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blest if I knows.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve a good deal to
learn.&nbsp; What can you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, all sorts of things; stand on my <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>head,
&rsquo;old &rsquo;osses, do the Catherine wheel business.&nbsp;
Shall I show you?&rsquo; said the little fellow, emerging from
his wrap, and preparing to display his gymnastic powers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dash my buttons! the place ain&rsquo;t big enough,&rsquo;
said the boy with a disappointed air.</p>
<p>Presently the train came to a halt, and in a minute the boy
was under the seat, exclaiming in a fright:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, crikey! there&rsquo;s a peeler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he won&rsquo;t hurt you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t he; I know better than that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; you be a good boy, and sit still, and he
won&rsquo;t do you any harm; he is coming to look at the
tickets.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The railway official having departed, the lad began to look
out of the window, enjoying the way in which the train rattled
along through tunnels and over rivers, through fields and
villages and towns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now tell me,&rsquo; said the actress, &lsquo;did you
ever hear of God?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; where did he live?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor of Christ?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&lsquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ve often heard mother say
&ldquo;Oh, Christ!&rdquo; when father came home drunk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re a bit of a
heathen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said the boy, with pride; &lsquo;people
often call me that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After that the conversation dropped; the actress had much else
to think of, and the boy fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was late when the train reached London, and the actress and
her charge were deposited at the King&rsquo;s Cross
railway-station.&nbsp; The little fellow had slept all the way
up, and sorely were his eyes dazzled with the glitter of the gas
lamps, and his ears stunned as cab after cab drove away.</p>
<p>Muffling herself as much as possible, and dragging the little
fellow after her, the actress rushed along the platform to where
a neat brougham was drawn on one side, waiting for its owner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re here, Jarvis, are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; was the reply, as the coachman
touched his hat.&nbsp; &lsquo;Drive home, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;
said he interrogatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no; drive me to Clifford&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Jump in, my
little man,&rsquo; she said to the poor boy, and, following
herself, the brougham was soon spinning along Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Wentworth will be at home,&rsquo; said the lady
to herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder what lark missus is up to,&rsquo; thought
Jarvis, as the brougham made its way amongst the cabs and
omnibuses, chiefly burdened with a pleasure-loving and
theatre-going community returning from their night&rsquo;s
amusements.</p>
<p>Jarvis had one special virtue&mdash;unbounded confidence in
his mistress.&nbsp; He had been a valued coachman in a
gentleman&rsquo;s family, but in an ill hour for himself he had
unwittingly got mixed up with bad companions, through meeting
them in a public-house; and when they had been detected and tried
at the Old Bailey, he was sentenced to five years&rsquo;
imprisonment as one of the gang, though he had no more to do with
their crime than the man in the moon.&nbsp; The policemen,
however, had others of the gang who had sworn that he was one of
themselves, and he was taken off to Holloway, <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>where, as he
asserted his innocence, and refused to be comforted, the
chaplain, who wanted him to see that Providence had some good end
in view in his unjust incarceration, had come to regard Jarvis as
a very wicked fellow indeed.&nbsp; In time, however, he managed
to make his innocence clear to the Home Office, having devoted to
that purpose all the savings of his life, and he was suffered to
go free.&nbsp; As he was leaving, there was a little crowd at the
prison gate of pals waiting to welcome the emancipated and to
rejoice with those that rejoice, at the nearest
public-house.&nbsp; Benevolent people also were there, inviting
the released to a little breakfast and a religious service close
by.</p>
<p>Jarvis accepted the invitation; but as the address took rather
a personal turn and assumed him guilty when not, he walked out of
the room in no pleasant state of mind, and in the raw, cold,
foggy morning stumbled against one of the men who had borne false
witness against him.&nbsp; An altercation ensued, which ended in
his knocking <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>down his quondam acquaintance, and in his being collared
by the police.&nbsp; For that offence he was straightway taken
before the magistrate and let off with a fine, which quite
exhausted the little sum given him that morning on leaving
gaol.&nbsp; In his desire to earn an honest penny he went to his
old master, only to find him dead, and the place shut up.&nbsp;
In vain he sought out all whom he knew in the days of his
respectability; they received him coldly, were sorry to hear of
his misfortunes, and hoped he might meet with some employment,
but could do nothing for him themselves.</p>
<p>Day by day he wandered thus in quest of employment, day by day
he grew shabbier, day by day he felt himself less able to rise
superior to his difficulties.&nbsp; At length, overcome by
despair, he walked down to one of the Metropolitan bridges, and
jumped over.&nbsp; The Fates seemed propitious, and in another
minute he would have been as completely drowned as he wished, had
not a boat belonging to the Thames police been on the very spot
to which, unconsciously, he floated.&nbsp; <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>He was heaved
on board, dried, and refreshed, and the next morning taken before
the magistrate, to whom he explained how unfortunate he had been,
how he had no one in the world to care for him, and how
thoroughly tired he was of life.&nbsp; The magistrate remanded
him for a week, in order that he might once more enjoy the
inestimable blessing of being talked to by the prison
chaplain.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the case got into the
newspapers, and it was then that it caught the eye of our
heroine.&nbsp; Calling for a cab, she made her way to the
police-court, and when, in the course of a few days, the man was
released, made him her coachman and gave him a home.&nbsp; Clean
and smart, with contentment stamped on his honest face, no longer
with the wan cheek of starvation, no longer his eye heavy with
disappointment and despair, active and hearty and happy, there
was not a better or cleverer Jehu in all London town.</p>
<p>It was past twelve when the brougham stopped opposite the
little passage in Fleet Street, by the side of St.
Dunstan&rsquo;s Church, <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>leading to Clifford&rsquo;s
Inn.&nbsp; Of course the gate was locked&mdash;it always is after
a certain hour&mdash;and the porter had to be roused from
slumbers which, judging by the noise he made snoring, were deep
indeed.&nbsp; At length he slowly emerged from his den, looked
through the latch and opened the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Wentworth in?&rsquo; asked the actress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe so, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I will run up and see; but don&rsquo;t go to
sleep, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&nbsp; I shall be back
directly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a lovely night, and the moon, at the full, lent an air
of romance to the place.&nbsp; There was evidently a good deal of
life and gaiety going on&mdash;perhaps far more than the
authorities had any idea of&mdash;young men are fond of chambers,
and young men at the time of which I write were fond of sowing
wild oats in them, a remarkably unprofitable agricultural
operation.&nbsp; By daylight no one could imagine anything of the
kind went on, as one looks at the dull windows of the old
building, or sees here and there <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>a few lawyers&rsquo; clerks rushing
along either on business or in pursuit of lunch.&nbsp; It is a
handy residence for law students and pressmen, and in the daytime
it looks as dull and respectable as anyone could desire.</p>
<p>In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the noble family of De
Clifford granted to students of law a little plot of ground at
the back of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Church, Fleet Street, between
Fetter Lane and Chancery Lane.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are three
things for notice in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn,&rsquo; writes Leigh
Hunt: &lsquo;its little bit of turf and trees, its quiet, and its
having been the residence of Robert Puttock, author of the
curious narrative of &ldquo;Peter Wilkins,&rdquo; with its Flying
Women.&nbsp; Who he was is not known&rsquo;&mdash;probably a
barrister without practice&mdash;&lsquo;but he wrote an amiable
and interesting book.&rsquo;&nbsp; As to the sudden and pleasant
quiet in the little inn, it is curious to consider what a small
remove from the street produces it.&nbsp; But even in the back
room of a shop in the main street the sound of the carts and
carriages <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>becomes wonderfully deadened to the ear, and a remove
like Clifford&rsquo;s Inn makes it remote or nothing.&nbsp;
Charles Lamb&rsquo;s friend, the absent-minded Dyer, lived in
Clifford&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; The garden, now also in danger of
being built over, forms part of the area of the Rolls, so called
from the records kept there in rolls of parchment.&nbsp; It is
said to have been the house of an eminent Jew, forfeited to the
Crown&mdash;that is to say, that it was most probably taken from
him, with all it contained, by Henry III., who made it a house
for converts from the owner&rsquo;s religion.&nbsp; As it may be
supposed that most of these converted Jews were of doubtful
character, for high-minded men are not to be won from the faith
of their fathers by offers of board and lodging, we may imagine
there were at one time a good many queer characters knocking
about Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, and life was not a little
unconventional.&nbsp; It was so when Wentworth lived there,
especially after business hours, when the respectable solicitors
having offices on the ground-floor had <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>gone home to Clapham or Highgate to
dinner, leaving a few young ne&rsquo;er-do-wells who lodged about
there to run wild on the streets of London, then more full of
snares than now, and to return to bed at unhallowed hours.&nbsp;
The Serjeants&rsquo; Dining Hall has been dismantled; a new
street has been cut through the Liberty of the Rolls.&nbsp; There
are now few booksellers&rsquo; shops in front of St.
Dunstan&rsquo;s Church, and the two wild men of the wood who
struck the hour with their clubs on the old church have moved
elsewhere.&nbsp; What are we to expect of Clifford&rsquo;s Inn
but that it will soon be a thing of the past?</p>
<p>Curious characters lived in Clifford&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp;
Opposite Wentworth resided a City curate, of whom he knew nothing
save that he had a very red nose, was dressed in shabby black,
and came in at all hours.&nbsp; Overhead resided an old bachelor,
originally intended for the medical profession, but he did not
take to it kindly, and as he had a little property of his own he
preferred to vegetate in a cheap and yet scholarly way.&nbsp; <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>It is a sad
thing for a young man to have a little money, just enough to live
on, nothing more.&nbsp; Unless he be very ambitious, it at once
stops his career and prevents his making any attempt at rising in
the world.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why should I fret and fume?&rsquo; said
Buxton, for that was his name; &lsquo;if I get on, I only take
the place that might be filled by a better man, and so leave him
all the poorer.&nbsp; There are plenty of pushing fellows in the
world; why should I add to their number?&nbsp; Why should I not
take life easily, and content myself with my books and my pipe
and with the study of mankind?&nbsp; Is success in life worth
having?&nbsp; Is the game worth the candle?&rsquo;&nbsp; To the
questions he gave a negative reply, and in the freedom of his
unconventional life he rejoiced, and greatly did rejoice.</p>
<p>He and Wentworth were great cronies.&nbsp; They had both
original ideas, and loved to discuss them.&nbsp; Moreover, he had
saved Wentworth&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; They had met in the old city
of Hamburg in one of the most <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>old-fashioned houses, in which they
had apartments.</p>
<p>It was winter, and there was a fire in the old-fashioned
German stove which nearly filled the apartment.&nbsp; The girl
who attended the lodgers had lit the stove and left the flue
closed up, and consequently when Wentworth came to his morning
coffee and butterbrod the air of the tightly-closed
apartment&mdash;it was an unusually cold season that
winter&mdash;was too much for him.&nbsp; The fumes of the
charcoal fire filled the room.&nbsp; Wentworth in his ignorance
took his usual seat at the table, but in a few minutes was aware
that he had a very peculiar sensation in his head.&nbsp; As he
rose from the table to look at himself in the glass he fell prone
on the floor.</p>
<p>Buxton heard the fall, and rushed into the room just in time
to open the door and window and call for help, and when Wentworth
recovered his consciousness he found he had been carried by the
combined help of his landlady and Buxton to his bed.&nbsp; Thus a
tragedy was averted, and, like the <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>man in the &lsquo;Arabian
Nights,&rsquo; he felt that his life had been mercifully
preserved on account of the greater misfortunes yet to befall
him.&nbsp; After that, he and Buxton remained great friends.</p>
<p>Passing into the square, if square the tiny enclosure may be
called, at the back of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Church, the actress
looked up to Wentworth&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; It happened at that
moment he was lolling out of the window, lazily smoking a cigar
before he returned to rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who goes there?&rsquo; he exclaimed as he caught sight
of the well-known figure.&nbsp; &lsquo;To what happy circumstance
am I indebted for the honour of a visit at this unreasonable
hour, or has Ariel any commands for the humblest and most devoted
of her slaves!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course she has,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;or she
would not be dancing down here at a time when all respectable
people are in bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your angelship has only to speak, and I am at your
feet,&rsquo; said the smoker with a theatrical flourish, dimly
seen, and scarcely appreciated.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&lsquo;Well, I am in a mess, and I want your
help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you do; come up and talk it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I cannot stop a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, let me put on my hat, and I will be down in the
twinkling of any eye,&rsquo; and Wentworth withdrawing himself
for that purpose, in another moment he was by her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to take charge of a boy I&rsquo;ve brought
from Sloville; he is waiting in the bougham outside.&nbsp; He is
a little waif I&rsquo;ve picked up, and I want to save him from
going to the bad.&nbsp; Here he is,&rsquo; she exclaimed, as she
walked hurriedly to the brougham, and then opened the door.&nbsp;
Mr. Wentworth, or Ted, as his familiar friends termed him, was
not a little astonished at what he saw.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a
jewel!&nbsp; Is he not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather a rough one, apparently,&rsquo; said the
gentleman; &lsquo;but I suppose I must take him.&nbsp; He can
sleep on my coal-box, and, perhaps, when the laundress comes in
the <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>morning, she will be able to clean him up a bit, and
I&rsquo;ll see what can be done for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, I knew you would.&nbsp; It is so like
you,&rsquo; said the lady fondly, as she bade him good-bye,
telling the little forlorn lad to be a good boy, and drove to her
little bijou residence in Mayfair.</p>
<p>As she went off to sleep that night, there came to her the
words of the Master, &lsquo;Inasmuch as ye have done it to the
least of these My little ones, ye have done it unto
Me.&rsquo;&nbsp; At any rate, her reflections were more pleasant
than those of the Bishop&rsquo;s wife next door, whose father was
a City banker, and who, as she heard the brougham set its
mistress down, said to herself: &lsquo;What shocking hours these
actresses keep!&nbsp; What shocking lives they must lead, to be
sure!&nbsp; What a misfortune it is to have such a person for a
neighbour!&rsquo;&nbsp; It is to be believed the Bishop himself
had rather a different train of thought.&nbsp; As a curate he had
often frequented the theatre, nor had he given up the habit when
he became <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>a country rector.&nbsp; It is true, ever since his
elevation to the episcopal bench he had avoided the playhouse,
not that he did not love it in his heart of hearts as much as
ever, &lsquo;But, you see,&rsquo; as he was wont to observe in
his blandest manner, &lsquo;the case is altered now.&nbsp; I have
to consider my eminent position, and the decorum due to the
cloth.&nbsp; I must think of the injurious influence I might
exercise on the younger clergy, and on the laity as
well.&rsquo;&nbsp; He coincided with Bishop Lonsdale when he
said: &lsquo;So long as the world thinks it safer for young
ladies than for bishops to take their chance of being corrupted
by the theatre, he would by no means offend the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So completely had he managed to forget his former
propensities, that when it was hinted to him that there was a
time when he was often to be seen within a playhouse, he scarcely
admitted it, adding, however, that he had occasionally gone
there, not for the purpose of gratifying a worldly curiosity, but
that he might qualify himself by a study of our great actors to
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>become an
effective preacher and orator.&nbsp; He would have recognised the
actress, however, if his better-half had allowed him to do
so.&nbsp; But, naturally, not a fascinating woman herself, she
would save her lord and master from the snare of beauty, which is
but skin-deep, after all, and passing as the smile of an April
sun.&nbsp; Thus she was given to judge harshly of pretty women,
especially such as had become connected with the theatrical
profession.&nbsp; Yet what an actor she had for her
husband!&nbsp; What were his apron and knee-breeches and
shovel-hat but theatrical properties to impress and over-awe the
vulgar?&nbsp; As an actor, indeed, few surpassed the
Bishop.&nbsp; What a picture of devotion he was in church, as
with bowed head and uplifted hands he pronounced the
benediction!&nbsp; In gilded drawing-rooms, what an air he
assumed of Christian grace!&nbsp; In talk, no one was saintlier
in his way, and yet, as politician and Churchman, he had ever
been on the side of the world, and the Minister of the day ever
trusted him, as it was known <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>that his vote was safe.&nbsp; His art
was, Look much, and say little.&nbsp; &lsquo;Habits of graceful
movement,&rsquo; says a writer on Mental Philosophy,
&lsquo;should be early impressed on children, to prevent that
<i>gaucherie</i> which the want of an early training leaves
almost always behind.&nbsp; The mind and the will may henceforth
banish all thought concerning them.&nbsp; Once laid up among the
<i>residua</i>, ready for action, the motor mechanism will
reproduce them whenever the association prompts, and thus good
manners, as far as the outward expression be concerned, become a
part of our unconscious spontaneity.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s &lsquo;Characteristics,&rsquo; I recollect
there is a passage somewhat similar.&nbsp; Well, all this was
exemplified by the Bishop.&nbsp; How often do we see parsons of
all sects, and bishops, thus display this unconscious
spontaneity!&nbsp; A man is often assumed to be a saint simply
because he looks like one; alas! not all who bow to the name of
Jesus are Christians, nor a who look like
saints&mdash;saintly.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Their bended knees the ground;<br />
But God abhors the sacrifice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where not the heart is found.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The heart of our actress, at any rate, was right, and grateful
were her slumbers after the fatigue of an exciting day.</p>

76</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A YOUNG PREACHER.</span></h2>
<p>In one of the hottest days of the summer of 184-, a young man
of lofty bearing and aristocratic descent was riding on horseback
carelessly along the highroad that leads from Great Yarmouth to
Ipswich, and not many miles from the rising town of
Lowestoft.&nbsp; He had a companion with him not very much older
than himself, but with a face bronzed with foreign travel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How hot it is!&rsquo; said the younger of the two, as
he reined up his steed on the brow of a small hill, at the foot
of which was a stretch of marshland draining slowly into the sea
a mile off on his left, while on the other side of the marsh,
given up to cattle and horses and sheep, the road led to a <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>rising
tableland, dotted with old red-brick farmhouses and stately oaks
and dark firs.&nbsp; A painter such as Constable or Gainsborough
would have soon transferred something of the peaceful rustic
beauty all round to his canvas.&nbsp; Far off was the calm blue
sea, dark with slow-sailing colliers on their way to or from the
distant port of London; nearer the shore were the brown sails of
the fishing boats; while among them were a few pleasure yachts,
the proprietors of which were endeavouring to earn an honest
penny by carrying holiday makers to the sands which mark the
commencement of the Yarmouth Roads.&nbsp; Nowhere was the dark
line of smoke which marks the modern steamer visible.&nbsp;
England then trusted in her wooden walls and her sailors with
their hearts of oak, and dreamt not of the time when all that
craft should be replaced by big iron or steel built steamers,
ready to sink to the bottom, with all their crew and cargo or
passengers, in case of a collision, in the twinkling of an
eye.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&lsquo;Hot, is it?&nbsp; You should have been with me in
India.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And got wounded as you have?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you like.&nbsp; A good pension heals many a
nasty wound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; And here the younger man gave a
joyful exclamation, &lsquo;Why, there is Uncle Dick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True enough,&rsquo; said that individual, who was
urging on his steed at a furious pace, and had just joined
them.&nbsp; He was hawk-eyed, square-built, very red-faced, with
an eye anything but expressive of saintly life.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
the devil are you gay fellows up to?&nbsp; I thought you were far
away yachting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Duty,&rsquo; was the reply; &lsquo;the fact is, I am
rather tired of dissipation, and am thinking of settling down
quietly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear it,&rsquo; said the newcomer, who was
the wealthy incumbent of a neighbouring parish.&nbsp; &lsquo;But
you had better tarry with me for the night, and have a carouse
over some port that you can&rsquo;t get hold of every day.&nbsp;
I have done duty, and am quite at your service.&nbsp; This is
Sunday <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>night, and I propose a quiet rubber.&nbsp; The vicarage
is close by.&nbsp; I am a bachelor, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, we all know that.&nbsp; And a model priest and a
pillar of the Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, drop that,&rsquo; said the parson.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
is my misfortune that I have to wear a black coat rather than a
red one.&nbsp; You, lucky dog! can do as you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, uncle, we&rsquo;ll test your hospitality,&rsquo;
said the younger one of the horsemen, the elder accepting at the
same time.</p>
<p>They had already reached the village, the main street of which
consisted of a few houses and shops, with a lane which led to the
village meeting&mdash;an old-fashioned building of red
brick&mdash;towards which a crowd, at any rate, as much of a
crowd as could be got together in the village, was making its
way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are all these people up to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going to meeting, I suppose,&rsquo; said the
parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, are meetings allowed on the estate?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>&lsquo;Unfortunately, they are.&nbsp; My brother&rsquo;s
grounds only come up to the village, and the people there do as
they like.&nbsp; But it is getting late.&nbsp; Let us have a
trot.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unfortunately, as the horsemen broke into a
trot, they ran right into a group of poor people on their way to
meeting.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a poor old woman was caught by one
of the horses and thrown down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you much hurt?&rsquo; said a young man, running to
her rescue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Mr. Wentworth,&rsquo; said one of the group.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mother, I believe, is more frightened than hurt.&nbsp; We
would have had her stop at home, but she said she must come and
hear you preach.&nbsp; She said she was here when your father
came to preach for the first time, and we could not keep her at
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who are the men on horseback?&rsquo; who by this
time were far away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, one of &rsquo;em, the young one, is Sir Watkin
Strahan, with his uncle, the parson of the next
parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, for a young man, he was by no means
pleasant-looking.&nbsp; At any rate, he <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>might have
stopped to see if he had done any harm.&nbsp; But these rich men
are all hard.&nbsp; Poor people have but one duty&mdash;to get
out of their way, and to take their hats off to them when they
meet!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The expression of the young man was not to be taken
literally.&nbsp; Farmer and peasant alike never took off the hat
to anyone.&nbsp; The peasant simply made an obeisance and put up
his hand to pull a lock of his front hair in proof of his
deference to the ruling powers.</p>
<p>The crowd still clustered round the old woman, who was happily
more frightened than hurt.&nbsp; She was one of a class rarely to
be met with in our villages now, but at one time very
common.&nbsp; She was a &lsquo;meetinger.&rsquo;&nbsp; In some
way she was a sufferer for the fact.&nbsp; When Christmas came
there were coals and blankets at the Hall for such of the
villagers as attended the parish church, but the
&lsquo;meetingers&rsquo; were left out in the cold; and yet they
were the salt of the place&mdash;steady, orderly,
industrious&mdash;content with their lot, however humble and
hard.&nbsp; At <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>the meeting they were all equals, brothers and sisters
in Christ, believing that life was a scene of sorrow and
difficulty, of darkness and poverty and death&mdash;believing
also that that sorrow and pain would pass away, that that
darkness would be turned into light, that the tear would be wiped
from every eye, and the riches of heaven would be theirs in
exchange for the poverty of earth, that death should be swallowed
up in life.&nbsp; They studied one book, and that was the
Bible.&nbsp; Their talk was in Scripture phrase, and it was not
cant with them, but the utterance of a living faith.&nbsp; That
faith exists no longer, but while it lasted it filled the
peasant&rsquo;s heart with a joy that the world could neither
give nor take away, and there was peace and content in the
home.&nbsp; There was no day like the Sunday, no treat like that
of singing the songs of Zion, or of listening to the Gospel, as
they held the sermon to be.&nbsp; Nowadays our villagers prefer
to smoke a pipe and read the newspaper, and to talk of their
rights.&nbsp; Then they were of the same way of thinking as the
citizens of a <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>small German duchy, who, when the year of revolution
came across Europe, and the Grand-Duke gave them a representative
government, were much annoyed at the trouble thus imposed on
them, when he, the Grand-Duke, was born and endowed to do all the
ruling himself.</p>
<p>But the old lady was better, and to her we must return, as she
made her way to meeting.</p>
<p>The person most annoyed was the young preacher.&nbsp; He was
shocked at the autocratic insolence of the party.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall know that young fellow on horseback,&rsquo; he
said to himself, &lsquo;if ever I meet him again, which is not
very likely;&rsquo; and the young man continued his walk to the
meeting, where he was to preach.</p>
<p>When he got there the place was crowded.&nbsp; Tremblingly he
entered the vestry, and more tremblingly he climbed the pulpit
stairs.&nbsp; Everybody whom he knew was there.&nbsp; For a
village, it was a highly respectable congregation, consisting of
well-to-do shopkeepers and farmers with their <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>families, who
sat in genteel old square pews lined with baize, while the
labourers, in clean smock-frocks, filled the body of the
place.&nbsp; On the floor, just under the pulpit, was the
table-pew, crowded with all the musical talent of the
place.&nbsp; Loud and long and wonderful was their
performance.&nbsp; There are no such village choirs now, nor such
congregations.&nbsp; The landlords have put down Dissent in that
part.&nbsp; It is well understood that when there is a farm to
let no Dissenter need apply.</p>
<p>The old meeting-house yard was pleasant to the eye, with its
grand trees guarding the gates.&nbsp; It was a warm night, and
the doors were wide open, and from the pulpit the eye could range
over trim cottage gardens all ablaze with sweet flowers, whose
scent floated pleasantly along the summer air.&nbsp; From afar
one could hear also the echoes of the distant sea.&nbsp; There is
a wonderful stillness and beauty in a country village on a Sunday
night, that is if it be at a decent distance from town.</p>
<p>Even that dull red-brick meeting-house <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>was rich in
holy associations.&nbsp; It recalled memories of martyrs and
saints, of men of whom the world was not worthy, who had given up
all for Christ.</p>
<p>But let us turn to the present.&nbsp; In the pulpit is the lad
whom we already know.&nbsp; He has been at a London
college.&nbsp; This was his first sermon, and so still was the
place that even the Sunday-school children&mdash;always the most
troublesome part of the audience, and very naturally
so&mdash;were silent.&nbsp; For a wonder, in no pew was a farmer
asleep.&nbsp; The emotion of the dear old minister, as he sat in
the family pew, was painful to witness.&nbsp; That lad up yonder
was his only son, and had been set apart from his childhood for
the service of the altar.&nbsp; Like another Timothy, from a
child he had known the Scriptures.&nbsp; Like another Samuel, he
had been early trained to wait upon the Lord.&nbsp; Had the
prayers of pious parents been heard and answered?&nbsp; It seemed
so.&nbsp; But who can tell what later years may do for the
lad?</p>
<p>Let us look at him&mdash;tall, well-built, fair-haired, and
blue-eyed.&nbsp; He was trembling <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>and pale at first, but be was so no
longer.&nbsp; The nervousness with which he read the Bible and
offered up prayer has passed away.&nbsp; He has got accustomed to
the sound of his own voice&mdash;a great thing for an orator of
any kind.</p>
<p>The sermon was of the usual type&mdash;popular at that time in
all Evangelical circles.&nbsp; It would have been deemed sinful
to have preached in any other manner, and, after all, a raw lad
can but preach the theology he had gone to college to learn, or
which he had been taught on his mother&rsquo;s knees.&nbsp; In
religion, as in other things, you cannot put an old head upon
young shoulders, but as far as he knows the preacher is emphatic
and in earnest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Men and brethren and sisters,&rsquo; he exclaimed
towards the end of his discourse, &lsquo;will you not accept the
offered blessing?&nbsp; Dare you retire from this place rejecting
the offer of Divine mercy and the invitations of Divine
love?&nbsp; Will you continue in your sin and perish?&nbsp; Your
souls that can never die are in danger.&nbsp; Now God waits to
save <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>you;
to-morrow it may be too late.&nbsp; It may be that if you
procrastinate now you may never again hear the offer of the
Gospel.&nbsp; Turn your back on God now, and perhaps He may turn
His back on you.&nbsp; From this house of prayer, from the sound
of my voice, you may go home, to forget all I have said, or you
may be hurried away by the rude hand of Death.&nbsp; I speak as
to wise men.&nbsp; Judge ye what I say.&nbsp; Another throb of
this heart, another beat of this pulse, another tick of that
clock, and you may have gone to be alone with God.&nbsp; Life and
death are set before you&mdash;a blessing and a
curse&mdash;heaven and hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the young preacher, with eager eye and palpitating heart,
sat down, it was with difficulty that the aged father could
control his emotion so as to give out the hymn to be sung and to
pronounce the benediction.&nbsp; More than one sob was
heard&mdash;more than one face was bathed in tears.&nbsp; More
than one in that crowd resolved from that day forth to lead a new
and better life.&nbsp; <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>It was some time before that sermon
was forgotten.&nbsp; It was a village nine days&rsquo;
wonder.&nbsp; A time was to come when that young preacher was to
modify very considerably his theology and enlarge his
creed.&nbsp; It is to be questioned whether, however, afterwards
he ever preached with more fervour, or left a pulpit in a happier
frame of mind.&nbsp; When a man feels what he says, what place is
there in which he can feel more joyous than in the pulpit?&nbsp;
To men in such a mood it is the very gate of heaven.&nbsp; Shame
on the men who go into one without a Divine call and a living
faith, who are preachers by training and by the acts of mistaken
friends and relatives, who assume the priest&rsquo;s office for a
bit of bread, just as others become lawyers or medical men!</p>
<p>No wonder that the pulpit is a failure in our day; that men
who feel themselves equal in education and spiritual life to the
man in the pulpit stop away; that, in fact, men rarely darken
church doors&mdash;especially the poor, the weary, and the
heavy-laden, <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>who need something more than a musical performance, or a
religious ceremonial, or a sensational appeal.&nbsp; Yet are not
these the men for whom a Saviour lived and prayed and died?&nbsp;
When people were given to church and chapel going, something of
the life and energy of the old Reformers&mdash;the Wesleys and
the Whitfields, and their followers&mdash;had been left
alive.&nbsp; The old traditions had still a force; the old habits
had not died out.&nbsp; It had not become respectable to attend
what were then really the means of grace, if I may use such an
old-fashioned, conventional term.&nbsp; The world had not invaded
the Church, and swindlers and adventurers had not discovered that
if they would succeed in their schemes on the community, or get
returned to Parliament, or stand well in society, they must
identify themselves with one or other of the religious bodies,
whose members would supply them with a decent proportion of
dupes.&nbsp; It is a fine advertisement for a wealthy man to
contribute largely to the funds of the <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>religious body with which he is more
or less connected.&nbsp; Such pecuniary generosity always has its
reward.&nbsp; A working man candidate even who will get into a
pulpit is also sure of success, even if he intimates that the
parson does not know his business, or that the church and
congregation are groping in the dark.&nbsp; If now and then he
can get into a pulpit he is a made man.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">AFTER THE SERVICE.</span></h2>
<p>The village to which the reader has already paid a visit was
sleepy and healthy, but not without a certain rustic grace of its
own.&nbsp; At one end, the gates of the neighbouring park gave
almost an aristocratic air to the place.&nbsp; Far off among the
trees was the parish church, as if it never could be of any use
to anybody, while the old red-brick meeting-house was a
formidable rival, inasmuch as it was nearer to the people, and
therefore more convenient of access.&nbsp; It had quite a
history, that old place.&nbsp; Norfolk and Suffolk have been the
home of Nonconformists from the earliest times.&nbsp; One of the
first victims of the writ <i>De heretico comburendo</i> was a
Norfolk man.&nbsp; Dr. <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Grosteste, afterwards Bishop of
Lincoln, a divine of great learning and courage, who is said to
have sympathised with Wycliffe, was born at Stradbrook, in
Suffolk.&nbsp; The earliest martyr of the Reformation, according
to Fox, was William Sawtree, parish priest of the church of St.
Margaret in the town of Lynn, and here, as elsewhere, the blood
of the martyrs was not shed in vain.&nbsp; Heresy continued to
grow, and Mary, whom history calls the Bloody, owed her throne in
no small degree to the loyalty of the old Nonconformists of
Suffolk, who believed her to be the rightful heir to the Crown,
and aided her effectually in asserting her rights, only
stipulating that they should be unmolested in the exercise of
their religion.&nbsp; But Mary had learnt of her Popish priests
to keep no faith with heretics, and in Suffolk the race of
martyrs never failed.&nbsp; Many Protestants fled from this
fierce persecution, and some found an asylum in Frankfort.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth came to the throne the people still required a
reformation in the <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Puritan sense, but Elizabeth, a Ritualist herself, had
no sympathy with them.&nbsp; In 1592, when an Act was passed for
the punishment of persons obstinately refusing to come to church,
Sir Walter Raleigh declared his conviction that the Brownists at
that time were not less than twenty thousand, chiefly in Norfolk
and Suffolk.&nbsp; Their idea was that, in the language of their
founder, &lsquo;The Church planted or gathered is a company or
number of Christians and believers, which, by a willing covenant
made with their God, are under the government of God and Christ,
and keep His laws in one communion.&nbsp; The Church government
is the lordship of Christ in the communion of His offices,
whereby His people obey His will, and have mutual use of their
graces and callings to further their goodliness and
welfare.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such was the teaching of old Browne.&nbsp;
In the good old times he was persecuted for saying it, and people
were sent to gaol for believing it.&nbsp; Nay, more, Barrow and
Greenwood, for doing so, were hanged at Tyburn.&nbsp; In the
village of <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>which I write there had been many Nonconformists, and
tradition told how the preacher was hidden in a tree while the
people listened below.&nbsp; When fair times came, ejected
ministers continued their services in a more open manner.&nbsp;
Wealthy individuals befriended them, and chapels were built and
endowed.&nbsp; In this way the meeting-house of which I speak had
come into existence.&nbsp; On the evening of which I write it had
been crowded.&nbsp; The one subject of conversation all that
night was the sermon.&nbsp; At that time all the cottagers took a
deep interest in theology.&nbsp; There was no end of theological
disputations, especially among the women, and as usual among the
most illiterate of the women.&nbsp; Some of them were
hyper-Calvinists, and on a Sunday would walk miles to the nearest
town in which the doctrines they loved to hear were
preached.&nbsp; The old preacher at the Congregational chapel was
not high enough for them.&nbsp; They were God&rsquo;s elect, and
they needed to be preached to as such.&nbsp; Then there were the
Ranters, who loved to <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>hear of a free salvation&mdash;of
instantaneous conversion&mdash;of how the Ethiopian had changed
his skin and the leopard his spots.</p>
<p>All had been to meeting that night, and all were delighted to
find how the young preacher had given utterance to their peculiar
and somewhat contradictory views.&nbsp; Then, there were the old
steady friends, who feared that the young man would be led away
by people&rsquo;s applause.&nbsp; He was said to have talent, and
that was not the one thing needful.&nbsp; He was said to be fond
of human larnin&rsquo;, and that was a mockery and a snare.&nbsp;
The more narrow-minded preponderated, as they always do in
religious circles, or, at any rate, as they did then.&nbsp; They
believed that &lsquo;Ignorance was the mother of
devotion.&rsquo;&nbsp; They were a stumbling-block in many a
promising career, ever ready to censure, ever ready to take
offence, ever ready to find fault, ever ready to hint a doubt and
hesitate dislike.&nbsp; How many have such kept away who might
have been useful members of the Church!&nbsp; How many have they
driven into doubt and scepticism and <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>despair!&nbsp; How true is it that
against stupidity the gods fight in vain!</p>
<p>It is a mistake to suppose a village life dull.&nbsp; It has
its public opinion&mdash;its hopes, its fears, its joys.&nbsp;
Its little life in its way is as intense as that of London or
Paris.&nbsp; Our great men and oracles and dictators&mdash;many
of our best men&mdash;come from our country villages.&nbsp; They
are our national nurseries.&nbsp; We cannot breed men or women in
the foul air of towns, where soul and body alike wither
away.&nbsp; If England is to flourish, we must get back the
people to the villages.</p>
<p>The other night Hodge paid me a visit, and to me, revolving
these things in my mind, as Cicero was wont to say, the Lord
Brougham after him, it seemed that it was worth putting in print
Hodge&rsquo;s opinions about things in general, and farming in
particular.&nbsp; Hodge is a Liberal, and will vote for the
Gladstonian candidate.&nbsp; Not that he takes much interest in
Ireland, or has any particular acquaintance with Irish
affairs.&nbsp; Hodge told me he did not read the newspapers, <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>solely
because he can&rsquo;t read at all.&nbsp; He left school before
he had mastered the elements, and the cause of his leaving was
this: He had, as boys will do, played truant, and the next day
the schoolmaster took him to the door of the school to give him a
flogging.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the master had left his stick
behind, and when he was gone, Hodge, who had his cap in his
pocket, thought he might as well run away.&nbsp; He did so, and
went to a farmer to give him a job.&nbsp; The farmer set him to
scare the crows, and after that Hodge never went to school
again.&nbsp; At a proper age he went to ploughing, and a
ploughman he has been ever since.&nbsp; He married early, of
course.&nbsp; I told him that was a pity; but, as he said, what
was he to do?&nbsp; He had no father nor mother, and he wanted a
home of his own, and, though his wife worked in a brickyard, she
is as natty and tidy a little woman as you could wish to see
anywhere, and the children are neat and orderly.&nbsp; He lives
in a red-brick cottage with four rooms, for which he pays
&pound;4 a year, and has a nice little bit of garden, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>which
produces most of the food consumed by the family&mdash;for he
can&rsquo;t afford butcher&rsquo;s meat.&nbsp; Now and then,
though, he buys a few bones of the butcher, or a few scraps such
as a butcher has always to dispose of at the rate of sixpence a
pound.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t eat fat pork, and he can&rsquo;t
smoke.&nbsp; He is tall, but not stout, and has a fine colour on
his face, as if his occupation was healthy.&nbsp; His wages are
13s. 6d. a week&mdash;not a bad wage in Essex.&nbsp; His hours
are long&mdash;from six in the morning till half-past five in the
evening.&nbsp; On a Sunday morning he has to look after the
horses; when he has done that he walks over to have a chat with
his father-in-law.</p>
<p>He never goes to church, because he doesn&rsquo;t like the
goings-on in the church and the white gowns.&nbsp; When he goes
anywhere, it is to a barn where a Primitive Methodist preaches;
him he can understand, but not the Church parson; and the
Methodist preaches well and does not take a sixpence.&nbsp; That
is why he likes the Methodist preacher.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the parson makes a
poor-rate in the church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve seen the farmers go round with the
plates and collect money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;that is the offertory,
and the parson gives the money to the poor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he?&rsquo; said Hodge.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
never heard of his giving any money away, and he has never been
near me, though I&rsquo;ve lived five years in his
parish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I explained that the late parson was old and infirm, but that
the new parson would do better; and then Hodge admitted that he
had heard as how he had called on a neighbour who was ill, and
had left two half-crowns.</p>
<p>Hodge is not a teetotaler, but drinks a table-beer which his
wife brews.&nbsp; As to public-house beer, he declares it is
poison, and never touches a drop.&nbsp; He pays to the Foresters
five-and-sixpence a quarter, and shilling for his wife, and that
secures him in case of sickness ten shillings a week and <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>medical
attendance for his wife and family.&nbsp; He goes to bed at nine
o&rsquo;clock, and that means a good deal of saving in the matter
of coals and candles.&nbsp; He frankly admitted that he had made,
and could make, no provision for old age.&nbsp; He had one
grievance.&nbsp; His master was a Liberal, but he had told him
now that schooling was free he must pay two shillings more for
his rent; &lsquo;and that ain&rsquo;t very liberal,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Then we talked about the farmers.&nbsp; They were very hard on
the men.&nbsp; When harvest time came, that was the miserablest
time of the year, for the big farmer goes round to the small
farmers and tells them what he is going to pay, and then the men
stand out, and are idle and walking about, while a lot of
foreigners&mdash;that is, people from parts adjacent&mdash;come,
who are bad workers and get drunk, and are very disagreeable to
have anything to do with.&nbsp; There ought to be no large
farmers who cannot properly attend to the farms, and who keep
hunters and go out hunting.&nbsp; He would have no hunting at
all, as it destroyed the crops to <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>have a lot of men galloping over
them.&nbsp; Farmers could not make their farms pay, as they did
not keep enough men to pull up the weeds, and he had seen fields
where the thistles were as high again as the barley, and instead
of carting barley the farmer had to cart weeds, and that could
not pay.&nbsp; Again, he thought it was madness to send the
manure of towns into the sea when it was wanted on the
land.&nbsp; Farmers were very unreasonable, and that was a
pity.&nbsp; How could a farmer expect his men to work well if
they were paid starvation wages?&nbsp; They even starved the
horses.&nbsp; Many a farmer on a Sunday, or when the horses were
idle, took off a feed of corn from the horses.&nbsp; Why, did not
a farmer want his dinner on a Sunday when he was not working, and
was it not the same with the horses?&nbsp; He had seen some
farmers hunting, and their horses were nothing but bags of
bone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what do you think of allotments of two or three
acres?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; Hodge evidently had a poor opinion of
them.&nbsp; If <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>he had one, he would not have the time nor the strength
to work on it, though his wife might help him, as she was used to
outdoor work; and then there was the ploughing, how could that be
done?&nbsp; Could not, I asked, a farm be cut up into allotments,
and one person make a living by ploughing for the others?&nbsp;
No, he did not think that could be done, as you could never get a
lot of people to be all of one mind in that respect.&nbsp; It was
not much use giving an agricultural labourer more than forty rods
to attend to.&nbsp; He did not keep bees, as his master did not
like them, but his father-in-law did, and he made a good deal of
money by them.&nbsp; One thing he did by which he made a little
money, and that was to breed canaries.&nbsp; Once upon a time he
caught a blackbird and took it home.&nbsp; Then he sold it for
five shillings, and when his wife missed the bird he put a
shilling to it and bought a canary.&nbsp; His master&rsquo;s
brother gave him another; and as they laid eggs and hatched them
he sold canaries, and thus made a little.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Hodge
is an active politician, and attends all the Liberal gatherings
of the district; but his politics are of the dimmest kind.&nbsp;
He is attracted by the word Liberal&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; What
he desires is to see a better understanding between the masters
and men.&nbsp; He has got beyond the Church parson, evidently,
but the farmer may yet win him back.&nbsp; I question whether the
farmer will have sense enough to take the trouble to do that,
easy though the task may be.&nbsp; In the majority of cases it is
only a question of a shilling a week and a few kind words.&nbsp;
Hodge has no wish to be driven off the land.&nbsp; He would
rather remain where he is.&nbsp; He knows very little of the
town, and is rather afraid of its wickedness and its filthy
slums.&nbsp; All he requires is a little more consideration, a
little more kindly treatment on the part of his employer.&nbsp;
He is a good fellow, and he deserves it.&nbsp; But one sighs as
one thinks</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Of the rarity<br />
Of Christian charity<br />
Under the sun.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>But
this is a digression.&nbsp; I now return to the Hodge of half a
century ago.</p>
<p>It was late that night before the villagers went to bed,
everyone had so much to say.&nbsp; There had not been such an
excitement there since old Campbell, missionary to Africa, had
told the people all about the poor Hottentots.</p>
<p>Half-way down the High Street stood the Spread Eagle&mdash;as
times went, a respectable public-house, licensed to let
post-horses, and warranted to provide suitable accommodation for
man or beast.&nbsp; It is true, on the outside was painted a
fierce creature, intended for a bird, with an eye and a beak
enough to frighten anyone, but all was peace and harmony
within.&nbsp; The landlady had a way of serving up mulled porter
at all hours which seemed particularly attractive to her
customers, especially in winter, and as the coach to London
changed horses there, a good many people were in the habit of
dropping in &lsquo;quite promiscuous,&rsquo; as some of us
say.&nbsp; On the evening of the sermon, the bar-parlour <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>was
unusually full.&nbsp; The landlady&rsquo;s niece had been to hear
the young divine, and her verdict was favourable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty go,&rsquo; said the Rector, who
had dropped in quite accidentally, as he joined the group:
&lsquo;that young Wentworth is going to drive the people
crazy.&nbsp; As I came past I saw all the parish there.&nbsp; I
am sure Sir Thomas&rsquo; (the owner of the next village)
&lsquo;will be very angry when he hears of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right you are!&rsquo; cried the surgeon; &lsquo;but the
young fellow won&rsquo;t stop here long, you may depend upon
it.&nbsp; He is far too good for the meetingers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish the whole pack of them would clear off,&rsquo;
continued the Rector; &lsquo;they give me no end of
trouble.&nbsp; If I go into a cottage, I find they have been
there before me.&nbsp; It is just the same with the schools; they
get all the children.&nbsp; My predecessor did not mind it, but I
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the landlady, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard
my mother speak of him.&nbsp; He and the clerk had always a hot
supper here on a Sunday <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>night.&nbsp; Ah, he was a gentleman,
and behaved as such.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rare times, them was,&rsquo; said an old farmer,
joining in the conversation.&nbsp; &lsquo;I remember how we used
to pelt them meetinger parsons with rotten eggs.&nbsp; It was
rare fun to break their windows while they were preaching, and to
frighten the women as they came out.&nbsp; One day we were going
to burn the parson&rsquo;s house down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why did you not?&rsquo; asked the surgeon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because the Rector&rsquo;s wife was ill,&rsquo; was the
reply, &lsquo;and the Rector asked us not to make a noise near
the house.&nbsp; But I was sorry we did not then finish the job
outright.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d all have gone.&nbsp; Says I, if you
want to get rid of the wasps, burn their nests.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
no patience with a lot of hypocrites, professing to be better
than other people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the landlady&rsquo;s
niece, a privileged person, as she was both young and
good-looking, &lsquo;all I can say is, <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>young Mr.
Wentworth preached a capital sermon to-night.&nbsp; A better
sermon I never heard.&nbsp; There was no reading out of a
book.&nbsp; It was all life-like.&nbsp; There was no drawling or
hesitation.&nbsp; He spoke out like a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The aunt looked solemn.&nbsp; This would never do.&nbsp; The
Spread Eagle had always supported Church and State, and she was
not going to change at her time of life.&nbsp; It was too bad to
find heresy in her own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;of course I don&rsquo;t
go to meetin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;m very sorry to hear what
I&rsquo;ve heard to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we will forgive the young lady,&rsquo; said the
Rector condescendingly, with a familiar nod, &lsquo;on condition
that she does not do it again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Agreed,&rsquo; said the surgeon.&nbsp; &lsquo;I go to
church,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;because it&rsquo;s
respectable; because my father went there before me; because, if
I did not, I should never be asked to dine at the Hall; because,
as it is, I find it hard to make both ends meet, <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and should
lose all my practice if I went to meeting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides,&rsquo; added the Rector, &lsquo;it is your
duty to support the institutions of your country, and to set the
people a good example.&nbsp; I am not much of a Churchman
myself.&nbsp; I had rather have been a country squire, but my
father said I must either take the family living or starve, so,
as starving is not in my way, here I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a better parson we don&rsquo;t want,&rsquo; said
the old farmer enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I try to do my duty in the situation in which
Providence has placed me,&rsquo; said the Rector, with a truly
edifying air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We knows that,&rsquo; said the farmer,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve allus a bottle for a friend, and you give us
short sermons, and when we want to get up a race or a bit of
sport, you are always ready to lend us a helping hand, and that
is more than the meetingers ever do.&nbsp; I hates &rsquo;em like
p&rsquo;ison.&nbsp; All their talk is of eddication and
religion&mdash;good things in their way, but not to be
overdone.&nbsp; My best ploughman can&rsquo;t read a bit, and
what <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>good will larnin&rsquo; do him, I should like to
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And here the farmer, red in the face, paused for a
reply.&nbsp; In the meanwhile the Rector called for the Sunday
paper, which had reached there that evening.&nbsp; The surgeon
set off to attend a patient in labour&mdash;his principal
employment in that healthy district, where the people kept good
hours and breathed good air&mdash;and the bar-parlour of the
Spread Eagle resumed its Sabbatic quiet.&nbsp; Only one should-be
sleeper lay awake that night, and that was the village
pastor&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; He was to go on probation to
Sloville.&nbsp; There was no minister there, and the people
wanted one.&nbsp; Was he to succeed?&nbsp; Did he sufficiently
realize the import of his message?&nbsp; Had he so mastered the
truth that he could commend it in all its fulness and beauty to
others?&nbsp; These were questions which gave him&mdash;as they
do all in such a position&mdash;great searchings of heart.&nbsp;
At college Wentworth had difficulties which were only to be put
away, said his teachers, by Christian work.&nbsp; They, <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>good
people, had had doubts themselves, but they had lived them down,
and so they went to their daily task quite satisfied, and they
reaped the benefit of acquiescence as they became more and more
celebrated for wisdom and piety, and as more and more they lost
the meaning of Scriptural language in conventional and orthodox
formula.&nbsp; Subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles was not
imposed on the young divine; but he was expected, nevertheless,
to adopt a certain creed, and repeat it.&nbsp; Students at his
college were not expected to study truth, but only as it appeared
in a human, rather than a Divine, form.&nbsp; Any attempt at
independent inquiry was rejected as heresy of the most odious
kind.&nbsp; Happy were they who never had their minds darkened by
doubt, who, according to their own ideas, were taught of the
Spirit; who found every difficulty solved by prayer: to whom
Deity revealed Himself, as He did to the Jews of old, as a pillar
of cloud by day and of fire by night; who felt that their God was
a jealous God, consuming with <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>eternal fire the reprobate; who
believed that God was angry with them if they took a walk in the
fields on a Sunday, or kept studying secular affairs one moment
after twelve (Greenwich time) on a Saturday night.&nbsp; To this
class Wentworth did not belong.&nbsp; He was wont to regard the
Creator of the world as a Father in heaven&mdash;as a God of
love&mdash;who had filled all this wide earth with beauty for man
to grasp and enjoy.&nbsp; Pious people said he lacked
unction.&nbsp; But he was anxious for action, as all young men
are, for real life and real work, and desirous &lsquo;to
settle,&rsquo; as the phrase is.&nbsp; His father was poor, and
could not afford to keep him at home.&nbsp; He had finished his
college career&mdash;with acceptance.&nbsp; No one had a word to
say against him, and none doubted his ability.&nbsp; At Sloville
the people were supposed to be profoundly orthodox.&nbsp; It was
hard indeed to send such a young man there, yet it was agreed
that Wentworth should go there on probation.</p>
<h2><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AT SLOVILLE AGAIN.</span></h2>
<p>It was with rather a heavy heart young Wentworth found himself
in the ancient town of Sloville, amongst some hard and elderly
deacons, who had little sympathy with him or his ways.&nbsp;
Everything in the Dissenting creed was dull and dreary.&nbsp; At
that time there were no athletic sports&mdash;no outlet for that
vigorous animal life which is common alike to saints and sinners,
to the young preacher as well as to the young layman.&nbsp; Now,
when even curates devote themselves to lawn tennis, a freer life
is tolerated, and we do not find fault with even an ordained
parson who can run, or play cricket, or display animal as well as
intellectual or moral vigour.&nbsp; At the time this history <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>refers to,
this was not the case, and much did the Church suffer and the
world gain in consequence.&nbsp; Young people must have
amusements.&nbsp; It is unnatural to ask them to give them
up.&nbsp; Amusements are not only lawful but necessary.&nbsp; But
at Sloville this was denied, and our young minister was always in
hot water.&nbsp; It is true that he did not dance&mdash;that was
an outrage on the feelings of the Church too awful to
contemplate&mdash;but it was known that he enjoyed a game of
chess.&nbsp; It was whispered that he had confessed to a
knowledge of whist, and had been heard to own to a little time
wasted on billiards.&nbsp; If he had said bagatelle, people would
not have so much minded.&nbsp; The senior deacon had a
bagatelle-board himself in his own house; not that he played, he
was far too serious for that, but his young people required
amusement, and he was forced to give way.&nbsp; But
billiards!&mdash;that was quite another matter.&nbsp; That was a
game played by wicked men in public-houses and at London
clubs.&nbsp; Men had been ruined at it, families had been
beggared <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>by it; even suicides had been the result.&nbsp; No,
that was not a game on which you could pray for a blessing.&nbsp;
Yet Mr. Wentworth had been heard to say that he knew something
even of that atrocious game.&nbsp; They were very bilious, and
therefore very pious, these good deacons.&nbsp; We have improved
a little since then, but types of them are still to be found
scattered all over the land.</p>
<p>Under this strict regime, as was to be expected, there was not
a little restlessness at Bethesda, as the chapel was
called.&nbsp; The young preacher was popular, but not, alas! with
the soberer and elder portion of the congregation.&nbsp; The
deacons were sorely puzzled how to act; some questioned whether
the young student had the root of the matter in him, and many
were their meetings.&nbsp; Let us go amongst them, as they are at
tea, and in the house of one of them, the leading tradesman of
the town, a dear old deacon, who from the time he had known the
Lord, as he termed it, had never known a doubt, and to whom no
sermon <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>was tolerable that did not begin with ruin and end with
regeneration and redemption.&nbsp; The house in which he resided
was one of the most respectable in the High Street.&nbsp; It was
entered by the side door, and not through the shop&mdash;that was
of itself a sign of gentility.&nbsp; On the present occasion, all
the company have come in by the private door, and, dressed in
black, you might have taken them for a gathering of the brethren,
so thoroughly clerical was their look and demeanour.&nbsp; Of
course, they were all professors, as they were called, not of
music or mathematics, but of religion.&nbsp; The head of the
party, in whose parlour they were seated, and of whose
hospitality they were partaking, was the senior deacon of the
Independent Chapel.&nbsp; His parents were very poor, but they
had sent him to school, and were specially careful that he should
be a Sunday scholar.&nbsp; In a little while he became a
Sunday-school teacher, and that was a feather in his cap, and
helped him to pray and make speeches in public.&nbsp; One of the
friends thus gained was <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>a small shopkeeper, who in
consequence took Ned Robins, as he was called, into his
employ.&nbsp; The lad was steady, of a cold temperament, very
selfish, and ambitious to rise in the world.&nbsp; He had no wish
nor temptation to be otherwise.&nbsp; He was always at his post,
never went to the public-house, never wanted to go to a race, or
a fair, or a rowing match, never wished for a holiday, and,
consequently, never took one.&nbsp; He had married his
master&rsquo;s daughter; he had courted her on a Sunday when they
went to chapel together&mdash;that is, they sat in the same pew
and sang out of the same hymn-book&mdash;and as everyone said
they ought to make a match of it, they did so accordingly.&nbsp;
By that match he became proprietor of the business, which grew as
the town grew, so as to become really worth having.&nbsp; His
boys were in the business; his daughters, with the exception of
one of them, rather prettier than the rest, were all members of
the church, and had married other tradesmen in the town.&nbsp; A
good tea did he give his friends, in the best parlour, with the
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>very
best tea-things.&nbsp; Truly, he had much to be thankful
for.&nbsp; He had never dishonoured a bill, and his good name was
unquestioned.&nbsp; If he occasionally sold adulterated articles,
that was the fault of the manufacturer, not his.&nbsp; His
favourite verse was,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Not more than others I deserve,<br />
Yet God has given me more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;apparently quite unaware that, in saying so, he cast a
slur upon his Maker.</p>
<p>In the parlour itself there was every sign of comfort, in the
way of easy-chairs, and sofas, and good mahogany.&nbsp; Over the
fireplace was a good-sized looking-glass.&nbsp; Opposite to it
was a bookcase, inside the glass shutters of which was a set of
<i>Evangelical Magazines</i>, well bound, a Matthew Henry&rsquo;s
Commentary, an illustrated &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s
Progress,&rsquo; and a large folio copy of Fleetwood&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Life of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; For the young people there
were Cowper&rsquo;s Poems, those of Jane Taylor, and
Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Paradise Lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the
best-thumbed <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>volume in the collection was the &lsquo;Cookery
Book,&rsquo; for neither the master nor his wife approved of
starving the tabernacle or mortifying the flesh when their
pleasure lay in an opposite direction.&nbsp; In the way of
ornament the room boasted of portraits of a murdered missionary
and a leading London divine, who had been popular in his
denomination in his day, and oil-paintings of the master of the
house and his missus, by no means flattering to either.&nbsp; The
windows were lined with heavy curtains that kept out the
cold.&nbsp; The fire burnt brightly on the hearth.&nbsp; The
seductive tea-urn sent its rich aroma all round.&nbsp; Plum-cake
and hot buttered toast, to say nothing of muffins, were
plentiful, while a real Yorkshire ham tempted one to cut and come
again.</p>
<p>The deacon and his wife loved to be happy in their way, and it
was with pardonable pride they sat down to the feast, and
gathered around them their chapel friends.&nbsp; They fell
bravely to work, as soon as the compliment had been passed of <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>asking the
eldest of the visitors to say grace.&nbsp; The one selected was a
chemist, the other who returned thanks was a farmer, who, if
goodness was tested by a tendency to sleep all sermon-time, was a
saint indeed.&nbsp; His drowsiness, he admitted, was an
infirmity, but it was one against which he seemed to make no
effort.&nbsp; He was wide-awake enough when he had a horse to buy
or a bullock to sell.&nbsp; After the guests had satisfied the
wants of their inner man, and discussed the state of the weather,
and the corn-market and the crops, they began discoursing.&nbsp;
Let us listen to them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jones, the farmer, &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t think that young man who preached on Sunday was the
sort of man we want for Bethesda.&nbsp; It was all very fine,
and, if I had not been a Christian, I should have enjoyed it
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mere morality,&rsquo; said Stephens, the chemist and
druggist, &lsquo;not a word for the poor sinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet the chapel was crammed full at <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>night, and
I hear we shall have a larger congregation next
Sunday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And a deal of good that will do us.&nbsp; Larnin&rsquo;
and eloquence will never save a soul.&nbsp; If the root of the
matter an&rsquo;t there, what&rsquo;s the use of them?&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t want a lot of giddy creatures coming along and
crowdin&rsquo; up the place.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be bound to say
that young man is a Neologist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A what?&rsquo; all asked with horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Neologist; and if you want to know what that is, read
the <i>British Beacon</i>.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo; bless you! the editor
makes fine work of the Neologists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, of course we don&rsquo;t want a Neologist down
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never heard such a sermon.&nbsp; Nothing about being
born in sin and shapen in iniquity.&nbsp; Not a word about hell;
not a word of the saints being preordained for glory.&nbsp; He
had the impudence to tell me, to my own face, that &ldquo;a God
of love would never consign sinners to an everlasting
torment.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;d quite an argument with him.&nbsp;
I called him all the names I could think <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of.&nbsp; I
really don&rsquo;t think I can bring myself to go and hear him
again.&nbsp; If you have him, I&rsquo;m off to the
Baptists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, look &rsquo;ee, you must not leave us, at any
rate.&nbsp; How the people would talk if you were to give up
Bethesda and join the Baptists!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We want the elect to be preached to,&rsquo; said the
chemist, &lsquo;not the world.&nbsp; Now, this young man has no
idea of that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all labour in vain preaching to
the world.&nbsp; The Lord knows them that are His.&nbsp; They are
the flock, and we want a shepherd for them.&nbsp; What are the
men of the world but a generation of vipers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the other deacon, &lsquo;it seems to
me that he has no idea of saying a word in season.&nbsp; For
instance, as you know, last week old Brown, the milkman, died
very suddenly.&nbsp; I said to him, &ldquo;Mr. Wentworth, you
might improve the occasion.&nbsp; You might preach about the
shortness of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How old was old
Brown?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eighty-five,&rdquo; says I,
and then he laughed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Laughed?&rsquo; repeated all the party.</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&lsquo;Yes; and said he had &ldquo;better wait for some
better opportunity to talk of the shortness of life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He said old Brown had had &ldquo;rather a long
innings.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>A shudder ran round the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just what I expected myself.&nbsp; Last week old Mrs.
Grey broke her leg.&nbsp; She would not go to our new surgeon,
because he ain&rsquo;t a professor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite
right,&rdquo; said I to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you expect the
blessing?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our new minister replied that &ldquo;the
woman was silly&rdquo;; that &ldquo;she should have gone to a
clever, rather than to a godly, doctor&rdquo;; that &ldquo;it was
merely a question of professional skill,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;religion had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Says I,
&ldquo;We think too much of mere human talent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said
he, &ldquo;he did not think we did.&nbsp; It was so rare that
when we found it we ought to encourage it,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
I said to him, &ldquo;Our old minister never preached in that
way;&rdquo; and he said he was &ldquo;sorry to hear
it.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again all groaned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just what I expected,&rsquo; observed the <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>chemist and
druggist.&nbsp; &lsquo;The other morning, as I called, he was
reading Shakespeare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not much there for the immortal
soul,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you there at all.&nbsp; I hold
Shakespeare to be next to the Bible.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said as how I
had never read a line of Shakespeare, or any other play-acting,
fellow.&nbsp; Said he, he was &ldquo;sorry to hear
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had &ldquo;missed a great treat.&nbsp; There
was no one like Shakespeare to display the workings of the human
heart.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did you say to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that my Bible told me that the heart was
&ldquo;deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked,&rdquo;
and that was enough for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you had him there,&rsquo; said the others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I think I had,&rsquo; replied the chemist, with a
grim smile of satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is told of the Aristotelians, when Galileo offered to show
them that the world moved round the sun, that they refused even
to use his telescope, as they would not see what they could not
find in <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>Aristotle.&nbsp; These poor men would have done the
same.&nbsp; Science offered them a telescope, but they preferred
darkness, like the old bigoted Roman Catholics who persecuted
Galileo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know my boy Tom,&rsquo; continued Mr. Robins.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He thinks he knows a lot more than his father, because I
sent him to the grammar-school.&nbsp; He always is telling me he
don&rsquo;t see this, and he don&rsquo;t see that.&nbsp; Now,
according to my way of thinking, he has no right to talk
so.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really sinful.&nbsp; He has got to
believe.&nbsp; The Bible says, &ldquo;Whoso believeth shall be
saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; I says to the lad, &ldquo;If I had talked in
that wicked way to my father, he would soon have beaten it all
out of me, and I had a great mind to do the same with
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said as much to the minister.&nbsp; He begged
I would &ldquo;do nothing of the kind.&nbsp; The lad could not
help his doubts.&rdquo;&nbsp; He believed he was
&ldquo;sincere.&nbsp; Thomas was one of the Apostles, and had not
he his doubts?&nbsp; Doubts,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;often lead to
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did you ever hear such a doctrine?&nbsp; I
saw the <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Lord in a minute when I was converted, and I&rsquo;ve
never had a doubt since, blessed be His Holy Name!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re right, brother,&rsquo; said the senior
deacon.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is the devil who makes us doubt, and it
is only by prayer you can defy him.&nbsp; You know&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Satan trembles when he sees<br />
The weakest saint upon his knees.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that we have got to do is to believe what is in the Bible,
and I do every blessed word of it, from the first chapter of
Genesis to the last Book of Revelation.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t talk to
me of carnal reason sitting in judgment on the Word of God.&nbsp;
It makes me sick to hear such talk.&nbsp; It is downright
wickedness.&nbsp; Human larnin&rsquo; will never save the
soul.&nbsp; Scripture is plain, so that the wayfaring man, though
a fool, may not err therein.&nbsp; The sooner we get an old
experienced divine to come and preach to us the better.&nbsp; We
shall have all the gay and giddy people at meetin&rsquo; if this
young fellow preaches here much longer&rsquo;&mdash;a sentiment
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>which
met with the hearty approval of all present.&nbsp; He continued:
&lsquo;It was only last night I asked him to come to supper, and
he declined, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; he said, he had
&ldquo;promised to sup with&rdquo; that new lawyer, who has come
to our town, and who, I believe, never goes anywhere of a
Sunday.&nbsp; &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;the Church has nothing to do with the world.&nbsp; We
are to be separate from sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he did
&ldquo;not take that view of the case.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said he
&ldquo;ought to,&rdquo; and left him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The deacons were rather hard on the young parson, assuredly,
and yet they were very good Christians in their way&mdash;ready
to pay for an improvement in the chapel, for books for the
Sunday-school, or to subscribe money to circulate the Bible or to
send forth the missionary.&nbsp; What they lacked was the rarest
of Christian virtues&mdash;charity; that charity which
&lsquo;suffereth long, and is kind; which envieth not; which
vaunteth not itself; which is not puffed up; which beareth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>all things.&rsquo;&nbsp; As our
young friend set people thinking, refused to repeat old sentences
and phrases like a parrot, and avoided religious clap-trap, he
was regarded by the deacons with alarm and suspicion.</p>
<p>Just then the shop-bell rang, and the senior deacon left the
company of his brother deacons to look after business.&nbsp; In a
few minutes he returned, looking a little annoyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, brother?&rsquo; said they
all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who do you think,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;was in the
shop just now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t guess.&nbsp; Pray tell us.&nbsp; The new
parson?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&nbsp; Rose Wilcox&mdash;that poor silly girl the
young men here make a fuss about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, the girl that used to teach in the Sunday-school,
and would have upset us all, had she not taken herself off?&nbsp;
A girl who&rsquo;ll come to no good end,&rsquo; said the chemist
and druggist, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Perhaps the deacon is right.&nbsp; It is a <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>terrible
world, this of ours, for a girl in lowly life who has more than
her fair share of feminine beauty.&nbsp; A thousand dangers lurk
on every side of her&mdash;from the enmity of woman, from the
selfish cruelty of man.&nbsp; It is rarely that she does come to
a good end.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think she said?&rsquo; continued the senior
deacon.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, that she came to hear Mr. Wentworth,
and that she hopes we are going to have him for the new
parson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Rose had unwittingly filled up the measure of the new
preacher&rsquo;s guilt.&nbsp; She was the prettiest girl in the
town, and, consequently, was supposed to be far, very far from
the kingdom.&nbsp; If Mr. Wentworth had preached so as to gain
the attention and excite the admiration of a young giddy girl
like that, he was not the man for Bethesda; and it must be owned,
I frankly admit, that he was not.&nbsp; He lacked what the
deacons called unction in the pulpit.</p>
<p>To be popular, to be attractive, to retain a hold on the light
and careless and the worldly, was the surest way to alarm the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>deacons,
who guarded jealously the sanctity of the pulpit&mdash;a sanctity
which had repelled from the chapel the very people whom,
now-a-days, the religious world wish to get there.&nbsp; They
were not of the world.&nbsp; That was their boast and
privilege.&nbsp; They were a chosen people&mdash;a peculiar
generation.</p>
<p>Outside were the wicked, for whom there was no
mercy&mdash;nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment and
fiery indignation of the wrath of God.&nbsp; They looked for
empty benches in chapel, for it was only the few that could be
saved.&nbsp; If a young person wanted to join the church, the
deacons were alarmed and surprised.&nbsp; It was almost a breach
of conventional etiquette.&nbsp; Hence the unattractive character
of their church life, the bitterness of their profession, the
unloveliness of their spirit, the feebleness and failure of their
efforts.&nbsp; It was a sin in their eyes to make religion
palatable to the worldly.&nbsp; Rarely did the sons of these good
men follow in their fathers&rsquo; steps, too many of them fell
into evil courses, and those of them who did <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>become
church members were by no means the salt of the earth.&nbsp;
Wentworth, as was to be expected, with his open, manly nature,
disliked not a little the spirit of the people&mdash;their petty
quarrels, their miserable ignorance, their attachment to the
letter, their forgetfulness of the spirit of the Gospel.</p>
<p>At Bethesda, as the meeting-house was called, there had been a
venerable and godly man in the pulpit for nearly fifty
years.&nbsp; Never had the grace of Christian humility been more
strikingly displayed than by him.&nbsp; He had ever been thankful
for small mercies&mdash;for the leg of pork, the ton of coals,
the load of wood, the old clothes for his children, the new hat
for himself&mdash;the casual gifts of sundry of his flock who
were not quite so stingy as the rest.&nbsp; The wear and tear of
a long life had taken all the fight out of him.&nbsp; Even the
parson of the parish held him to be a harmless man, and was sorry
to note how the race of such godly men was gradually becoming
extinct, as Dissent claimed not <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>kindly patronage, not condescending
toleration, but civil and religious equality.&nbsp; A wonderful
art had that old man for making things pleasant all round.&nbsp;
He was truly all things to all men.&nbsp; The young people rather
looked down on him, but he did not mind that.&nbsp; To his
deacons he was always respectful, and never did he offend in any
way their wives.&nbsp; Indeed, they had been known to take his
part when some stray guest, some pert young miss from London
town, had endeavoured to make fun of his old battered hat, his
rusty black clothes, his patched-up shoes, his grotesque figure,
his ancient air, his monotonous delivery, his high
doctrine.&nbsp; But the fact was, few young persons did go to
meeting, and, as the old people died off, the display of empty
benches and empty pews was a sorry spectacle.</p>
<h2><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CHARTISTS.</span></h2>
<p>After the war with France, which culminated in Waterloo,
England enjoyed a period of rest and repose; and she needed it,
after her long struggle, which had robbed her of thousands and
thousands of valuable lives, and heaped upon her a national debt
under the burden of which she still groans.&nbsp; Then came a
serious problem.&nbsp; The war over, what was to be done with the
residuum, who, in the good old times, had been marched off to the
tune of &lsquo;The Roast Beef of Old England,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Rule, Britannia,&rsquo; or &lsquo;God save the
King,&rsquo; to be food for powder, and to whiten with their
bones half the battle-fields of Europe?</p>
<p>At Sloville the difficulty was much felt, <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>till one or
two capitalists selected it as the site for manufactories.&nbsp;
It was in one of the midland counties, where collieries abounded,
and where canals offer a cheap means of transit for
manufactures.&nbsp; The place grew like Jonah&rsquo;s
gourd.&nbsp; In the twinkling of an eye it became a town.&nbsp;
All at once the sky was darkened with black clouds of smoke,
vomited forth by the mills, whilst long rows of red-brick
cottages, utterly barren of interest and comfort, spread
themselves over all the adjacent fields.&nbsp; For a time all was
<i>couleur de rose</i>.&nbsp; The neighbouring landlords kept up
their rents, and the farmers made a lot of money by supplying the
town; the tradesmen found business increase with no efforts of
their own.&nbsp; Everyone was making money, and if the poor were
badly off, it was chiefly their own fault, as what wages they
earned were too frequently squandered in the public-house.</p>
<p>But prosperity in this world is seldom of long duration.&nbsp;
The markets were glutted, because the foreigner, who had <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>only corn
to send us to pay for our wares, was prevented by the Corn Laws
from sending us his corn.&nbsp; At the same time we had a
succession of bad harvests, and bread was almost as dear as in
time of war.&nbsp; It is hard to be happy when you are
hungry.&nbsp; Discontent is the natural result of starvation, and
democratic newspapers and writers, who had never shown their
faces in the place before, were in great demand.&nbsp; It was an
awful sight to see the people sulking in the streets, starving in
their wretched homes, cursing&mdash;in some of the lowest of the
public-houses&mdash;all who were better off than
themselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;They were,&rsquo; they were told,
&lsquo;a down-trodden people, the victims of a haughty
aristocracy, or of a bastard plutocracy, that had fattened on the
blood and sinew of the white slaves.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Down
with the capitalist!&rsquo; was the universal cry; and so the
mills were burnt, as if by the destruction of workshops there
would be demand for work.&nbsp; Soldiers were quartered
everywhere.&nbsp; On every side was a rich class, face to face
with a hungry people, <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>rendered desperate by poverty, and
want, and wrong.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there had been bad times in Sloville before.&nbsp;
The farmers, according to all accounts, never had been able to
make both ends meet, and the poor had to live on the rates, a
fact which rather increased than diminished the evil, as the
people who had the most children got more than their fair share,
and a pauper had a poor chance of decent wages, unless he at once
got married, and begot as many sons and daughters as the
rest.&nbsp; But now there was a real crisis, as the mills had
stopped, and the manufacturers and capitalists went about with as
long faces as the farmers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, just at this
time, the leading banker in the place failed, or rather took
himself off with his family to the Continent, leaving his
creditors to suffer greatly for their misplaced confidence, many
poor tradesmen and windows losing their all.&nbsp; A good many of
the chapel people took it as a dispensation of Providence, and in
many a place the event was improved in that way.&nbsp; <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>The Lord
was angry with them on account of the general wickedness of the
town.&nbsp; A new leaf was to be turned over.&nbsp; There was to
be less trust in man&mdash;less pride in human
intellect&mdash;less confidence in the spread of
intelligence&mdash;a better observance of the Sabbath&mdash;a
more frequent attendance at the means of grace.&nbsp; A good many
of Hannah More&rsquo;s good-meaning tracts were reprinted and
distributed gratis.&nbsp; Alas! the times were out of joint, and
some of the people refused the tracts.&nbsp; They said they
should prefer something to eat, and all pious Sloville turned
from them in horror and despair.&nbsp; It was actually whispered
that there were people in the place who had been seen reading Tom
Paine, and were not ashamed to talk of the Rights of Man.&nbsp;
It is not much to be wondered at that such was the case.&nbsp; In
the old unreformed times, it was seldom that politicians, whether
Whigs or Tories, took much notice of the state of the
people.&nbsp; There was no law then to stand between the
mercenary millowner and his white victim.&nbsp; The rich made the
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>laws,
and all that the people had to do was to obey.&nbsp; Labourers
were even punished for combining to get decent wages if
possible.&nbsp; Wentworth, as a young man, was especially touched
with a sense of the hardships inflicted on the factory children
and women.&nbsp; The Church&mdash;I mean by it the religious of
all sects&mdash;stood by the masters.&nbsp; It was natural, but
awful nevertheless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give these poor people,&rsquo; said Wentworth,
&lsquo;more food and more justice, and we shall have a better
chance of making them Christians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The deacons did not see it in that light at all.&nbsp; They
were shopkeepers, and did not want to offend their best
customers.</p>
<p>Out of this burning and undying sense of wrong on the part of
the poor naturally arose the Chartist agitation.&nbsp; Men were
taught to believe that all the ills of life would
vanish&mdash;that every man, however idle and indifferent in
character, would have a fair day&rsquo;s wages for a fair
day&rsquo;s work, if they did but have annual parliaments, vote
by ballot, the payment of members, equal <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>electoral
districts, and the abolition of the property qualification for
members of Parliament.&nbsp; Orators laid hold of the
people&rsquo;s hearts as they waved and shouted for the
Charter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you give up your agitation for the Charter, to help
the Free Traders,&rsquo; said all of them, both on the platform
and in the press, &lsquo;they will not help you to get the
Charter.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be deceived by the middle classes
again.&nbsp; You helped them to get votes; you swelled the cry of
&ldquo;The Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill;&rdquo;
but where are the fine promises they made you?&nbsp; Gone to the
winds.&nbsp; They make dupes of you.&nbsp; That is all they aim
at.&nbsp; They want now to get the Corn Laws repealed, and that
not for your benefit, but their own.&nbsp; They cry cheap bread,
but they mean low wages.&nbsp; They parade the big loaf before
you, but, at the same time, you will find your share in it as
small as ever.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t listen to their cant, and
claptrap, and humbug.&nbsp; Stick to the Charter and Feargus
O&rsquo;Connor.&nbsp; You are slaves <a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>and fools if you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
Have votes, and then you will be your own masters.&nbsp; Down
with the Whigs&mdash;down with the Corn Law Repealers&mdash;down
with the mill-owners!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such were the favourite sentiments at Sloville.&nbsp; Nor is
it much to be wondered at that men with empty pockets and bellies
were ready not only to proclaim and believe such doctrines, but
to fight, in their rough and imperfect way, for them.&nbsp;
People of property were alarmed.&nbsp; The Government shut up a
few of the leaders of the Chartists in gaol, though that did not
make matters much better.</p>
<p>At Sloville, the poor people, instead of going to church and
chapel on a Sunday, to listen to parsons who preached obedience
to their betters, met to hear Chartist speeches and to sing
Chartist songs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us be patient,&rsquo; said one of the hearers, who
had not outlived the religious teaching of his youth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let us be patient a little longer, lads.&nbsp; Surely, God
Almighty will help us soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>Scornfully and loudly laughed his hearers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Talk no more about thy God Almighty,&rsquo; was the
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is not one.&nbsp; If there was one, He
would not let us suffer as we do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In London and in all our large cities were men who felt deeply
their misery and poverty, and were labouring earnestly for the
removal of their wrongs and the attaining of their rights.&nbsp;
But there were professional agitators as well, paid agents of
agitation, many of them mercenary wretches, who fattened on this
state of things&mdash;men who preferred to talk rather than earn
an honest living.&nbsp; They made the best of their
opportunity.&nbsp; Many of them were sots, and had a fine time of
it in public-houses; few of their characters would bear a very
close inspection.&nbsp; They travelled down into the country, and
sowed seed, which fell upon prepared ground.&nbsp; It was truly
sad to see the decent, sober workman, living at his best on
starvation wages, keeping his wife and family, not by work, <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>but by
pawning every bit of household furniture, every superfluous
article of apparel, dressing himself in rags.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sunday come again, and nothing to eat,&rsquo; said one,
while the poor babe sought its mother&rsquo;s breast in vain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said another, with a frenzied air, and with
language too vehemently blasphemous to be repeated, &lsquo;I wish
they would hang me.&nbsp; I have lived upon cold potatoes that
were given me these two days, and this morning I have eaten a raw
potato from sheer hunger.&nbsp; Give me a bit of bread or a cup
of coffee, or I shall drop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were riots, of course, for men in that state had little
to fear.&nbsp; Now and then a parson&rsquo;s house was burnt
down, or a magistrate had to fly for his life, or the agent of
some great landlord or millowner was in danger.&nbsp; The orators
worked up the passions of the people to fever heat.&nbsp; Now and
then appeared on the scene a stray Irishman, with a tremendous
tongue, or a wandering Pole, with the latest device for blowing
up houses, setting fire to mills, or <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>destroying the attack of a hostile
force.&nbsp; There was much talk of a chemical composition by
which London was to be fired in five places, and which would burn
stone itself.&nbsp; These schemers and dabblers assumed to speak
in the name of the Chartists, and the Chartists assumed to
represent the people of England.&nbsp; Never was a greater sham
than the agitation for the Charter.&nbsp; It was all wind and
fury, and utterly brainless; the concoction of journeymen
printers, patriotic tailors, heaven-taught stonemasons, and one
or two Methodist preachers and obscure journalists, eaten up by
vanity, and urged on by the belief that a revolution in England
was impending, and that they were to ride the whirlwind and
direct the storm.&nbsp; How they raved&mdash;like the madmen that
they were&mdash;of the terror that would give wings to British
capital to fly to other climes; of the middle-class population of
our country, broken down by bankruptcy and insolvency; of the
destruction of our commerce; of the awful doom of farmers,
manufacturers, and landlords!&nbsp; We hear <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>now of the
bitter cry of outcast London; that is nothing to the cry that
came from all parts of the country then.</p>
<p>It happened that just at this time there was to be a grand
Chartist demonstration in Sloville.&nbsp; At any rate, so it
seemed good to the editor of the <i>Trumpet of Freedom</i>, who
found the sale of his paper falling off, and subscriptions for
the national testimonial to be presented to himself not coming in
so abundantly as he could wish.&nbsp; At any rate, the
demonstration would serve to keep his name before the public, and
that was something.&nbsp; Accordingly, the proper machinery was
put in motion, and he got himself invited down, coming in a
post-chaise&mdash;there were few railways then&mdash;with his
secretary, as hungry a looker-out for power and pelf as
himself.&nbsp; They put up at the best hotel in the town, and
took good care not to starve either in the matter of eating or
drinking.</p>
<p>The excitement in the place was intense.&nbsp; There was a
lean and hungry mob all day long opposite the hotel, to cheer the
great <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>man whenever he came to the door or put out his head at
the window.&nbsp; The local leaders seemed as busy as if the
nation&rsquo;s welfare depended on them.&nbsp; Angry posters
glared on you from every wall, which the police in vain tried to
pull down.&nbsp; The great London newspapers sent down reporters;
and not a little was the indignation aroused when a myrmidon of
the law managed to serve the editor with a writ for debt, which
was explained to be a political dodge on the part of the
Government to muzzle the great man himself, whose invective on
the subject it did all the people good to hear.</p>
<p>The Whigs were denounced as base, bloody, and brutal; the
Tories were the devils in hell.&nbsp; The time had come for
tyrants and oppressors to tremble.&nbsp; Sloville was to be the
first to raise the standard, to strike off its fetters, to
emancipate the country from the grasp of a hireling soldiery, a
tithe-fed clergy, and a bloated aristocracy.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of brandy-and-water <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>in the
posters, and there was a good deal of the same refreshing
beverage in the speeches of the orators.&nbsp; A Chartist tailor
took the chair&mdash;a man who had at one time done well, but
who, since he had taken to politics and drink, had lost all his
business, and who naturally cast an envious eye on his more
successful fellow-tradesmen.&nbsp; He hinted at a plan for the
equal division of property, which was received with immense
applause, and which he assured his intelligent hearers would be
realized as soon as the Charter was the law of the land.</p>
<p>A Chartist shoemaker followed.&nbsp; At home he was a terrible
tyrant, dreaded by his much-suffering wife and his
much-to-be-pitied children: but that was no reason why he should
not denounce the tyranny of Government, which he did at some
length, and with much physical exaggeration and emphasis, to his
own delight and that of his hearers.</p>
<p>You could easily detect the Chartists in the town.&nbsp; They
were not the best workmen, but they were the best supporters of
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the
publicans, who at that time had not ventured to raise the cry of
Beer and the Bible.&nbsp; However, on the night of the
meeting&mdash;which was in the open air&mdash;all the workmen in
the place, good or bad, Chartist or not, assembled in
considerable numbers.&nbsp; The British operative is wonderfully
influenced by the gift of the gab.&nbsp; It always fetches him,
as Artemus Ward would say.&nbsp; He is not, as a rule, much of an
orator himself, and fluent and fervid declamation sooner makes a
fool of him than it does of the rest of the community.</p>
<p>The editor of the <i>Trumpet of Freedom</i> was aware of this
failing of the working-class, of whom he constituted himself the
champion, and was able to supply them with any amount of the
article in question.&nbsp; If he was poor in ideas he was rich in
words, in that respect being gifted almost as much as an Irish
orator.&nbsp; I need not give the particulars of his
speech.&nbsp; It was one he had often made before, and of a
character very common before the Corn Laws were repealed, when
the Tories were playing the <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>game of the Chartists, and
contending for all the abuses which the latter pointed to as
illustrations of the need of their famous remedy for all the
evils to which political flesh is heir.</p>
<p>The speaker was particularly severe on the lazy lives of the
parsons, and the way in which they humbugged the people.&nbsp;
They were charged with every crime.&nbsp; They were none of them
righteous, no, not one.&nbsp; If a profligate prince reigned, who
more fulsome in his praise than the Bishops?&nbsp; If a
profligate war was to be carried on&mdash;a war which was to
slaughter thousands of honest lads, and to reduce thousands of
homes to wretchedness and want&mdash;did not the Bishops
consecrate the banners, and offer up the mockery of a prayer to
heaven, as if God approved of such wanton slaughter?&nbsp; Did
they not always vote against the interests of the public?&nbsp;
Every parson was a robber of the poor.&nbsp; Did they not take
the tithes?&nbsp; Did they not take the part of the rich against
the poor?&nbsp; Did not they preach submission to the powers <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>that
be?&nbsp; Did they not drive the wretched voters, at election
times, to vote for the Tories?&nbsp; &lsquo;Down with the
parsons!&rsquo; said the speaker, and the cry was repeated
angrily by the mob.&nbsp; Some said, &lsquo;More pigs and fewer
parsons&rsquo;; others hinted it would be as well to march to the
Rectory, and to taste some of the Rector&rsquo;s old port; others
that there would be no great harm if they were to burn down his
house and hunt him out of the town.</p>
<p>Just as the mob were on the point of being goaded to the verge
of madness by the London orator, the young man from Bethesda
Chapel, as he was called, claimed to be heard.&nbsp; At first he
was received with disfavour.&nbsp; He was a stranger to them
all.&nbsp; That was against him.&nbsp; It was still more against
him that he had on a black coat and a white choker.&nbsp; A still
further offence was it that his tone was that of a
gentleman.&nbsp; Angry words were heard.&nbsp; He was a
spy&mdash;a Government informer&mdash;a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing&mdash;and ought to be ducked in the nearest
horse-pond.&nbsp; It was urged <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>that he might be permitted to speak,
in order that he might show what a fool he was.&nbsp; The London
orator especially headed all these anti-sympathetic
demonstrations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a parson,&rsquo; said Mr. Wentworth&mdash;then
there was a tremendous burst of indignation&mdash;&lsquo;and I
come here to show that a parson may feel for a poor man, and may
aid him in his efforts to obtain political power.&nbsp; It is not
all parsons who take tithes, but if you would abolish tithes
to-morrow, the only effect would be that the landlord would be
richer, that is all, as the difference would only go into the
landlord&rsquo;s pocket; but I come here to say, with you, that
you must have political power; that it is unjust and unfair to
deprive you of it; and I say so because I am a firm believer in a
book which is very unpopular here, called the Bible.&nbsp; It is
because I read that book that I wish you well.&nbsp; My Bible
tells me that I &ldquo;must love my neighbour as myself&rdquo;;
that I must do to others as I would have others do to me; and how
can I do this so long as we have class legislation, <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>and
injustice, upheld in the name of law?&nbsp; I deny the right of
Government to exclude you from the franchise.&nbsp; I agree with
much that has been said.&nbsp; There are abuses to be
remedied.&nbsp; There are rights to be gained.&nbsp; In the past
you have had unjust treatment, partly owing to your own ignorance
and partly to the selfishness of your rulers.&nbsp; You have been
refused education; you have been reduced to the condition of
serfs; you have been unfairly taxed; you have been denied the
chance of getting an honest living; you have been sacrificed to
high rents; and I think the parsons are much to blame that they
have not more openly taken your part.&nbsp; They have been too
prone rather to ask you to submit to what they call the
dispensation of Providence than to assist you in your righteous
efforts to get rid of bad laws and to secure better.&nbsp; It is
to be feared that, in some respects, you have acted
indiscreetly.&nbsp; Why turn friends into enemies by the
bitterness of your invective and by the absurdity of your
exaggerations?&rsquo;&nbsp; Here there were signs of
disapproval.&nbsp; &lsquo;You <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>have been badly
advised.&rsquo;&nbsp; (&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo;)&nbsp; &lsquo;You
are too easily made the dupe of the designing
demagogue.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here the London orator grew very angry,
and resented the attack as personal, as perhaps it was.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By the violence of your attacks on those who are ready to
help you, you make the gulf between you and your true friends,
the Liberals, greater than it really is.&nbsp; Especially do you
made a terrible blunder,&rsquo; continued the orator, &lsquo;when
you assume that Christianity and priestcraft are the same, and
that in this respect all parsons are alike, whether they be of
the Church of Rome, or of the Church of England, or Wesleyans, or
Baptists, or Independents.&nbsp; The Master whom I serve, and
whose Gospel I preach, was as poor as most of you; was the son of
a carpenter; was born in a manger; had not where to lay His head;
lived a life of poverty; died a death of shame.&nbsp; In His life
and death I see the Charter of your Freedom and my own.&nbsp; In
His promises you have solace and support in the bitterest of your
sufferings, under <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>the most grievous of your wrongs.&nbsp; You can have no
truer friend, no nobler guide.&nbsp; He can make sorrow and
suffering such as yours light as no one else can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the attention of the hearers relaxed.&nbsp; &lsquo;They
had not come there to hear a sermon,&rsquo; they said.&nbsp; One
Freethinker went so far as to shake his fist at the speaker,
while another enlightened hearer tried to make a grab at the
orator&rsquo;s coat-tail, in the hope to pull him down.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the speaker continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;To a great extent I, and most Dissenting parsons, at
any rate, sympathize with you.&nbsp; We are quite ready to go
with you at any rate part of the way; but you frighten us when
you talk of physical force.&nbsp; &ldquo;They that use the sword
shall perish by the sword.&rdquo;&nbsp; What could they do
against a disciplined military force?&nbsp; Mightier far is the
force of an enlightened public opinion.&nbsp; You can gain
nothing by violence.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t master the soldiers
and the constables, and you will array against yourselves a
public opinion which would otherwise be <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>compelled
to listen to your claims, and to treat them with the attention
they deserve.&nbsp; Many of the leaders in politics admit them;
many members of the House of Commons admit them; many of the
aristocracy are coming to your side.&nbsp; We have on the throne
a young Queen, who has a woman&rsquo;s heart of tenderness for
all that suffer.&nbsp; By rashness, by injudicious action, by
unwise invective, you may play into the hands of your enemies,
and thus put back the hour of your triumph for another generation
at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a howl which rendered further speaking
impossible.&nbsp; The crowd was split into two parties, those who
admired the young parson&rsquo;s sense and pluck, and those who
followed the Chartist agitators, who had their own ends to serve,
and their own ways of attaining them.&nbsp; The speech had, to a
certain extent, damaged them, inasmuch as it was clear many of
the respectable operatives present sided with the speaker.&nbsp;
The chairman, the committee, the editor from London, were as
angry as they <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>could well be.&nbsp; The effect of what was to have
been a mighty demonstration was destroyed.&nbsp; It was feared
the subscriptions would fall off.&nbsp; It was true, in the next
week&rsquo;s list, &lsquo;Junius Brutus&rsquo; was down for a
shilling, and &lsquo;A Hater of Tyrants&rsquo; for eighteenpence,
and others for a few sums equally small; but these were a poor
response to the chairman&rsquo;s appeal.&nbsp; In that same
number of the <i>Trumpet of Freedom</i> was a very scorching
article on the jackanapes of an Independent parson.&nbsp; There
is a great advantage in being an editor.&nbsp; An editor has
always the last word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There goes the scorpiant,&rsquo; said the chairman, as
Mr. Wentworth passed him, at the end of the meeting.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There goes the scorpiant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scorpion, I presume you mean,&rsquo; said the
individual alluded to.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; repeated the chairman
angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a scorpiant; that&rsquo;s what I
said, and that I&rsquo;ll stick to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Said another, whose few wits had been lost in beer, he&rsquo;d
&lsquo;as soon put the parson in the horse-pond as look at
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>The
gathering storm Wentworth took as a signal to retire.&nbsp; At
the outside women were weeping and shivering in the cold.&nbsp;
They were the wives of the Chartist committee-men, who sat
nightly in the public-house, spending money which the poor
deserted wives and mothers sorely needed at home.&nbsp; It was a
grievous sight, and the young parson grieved to think how little
he could do to remove the evil which existed all round.&nbsp;
Suddenly he found himself addressed by a young woman, whose
fresh, girlish face of beauty was a contrast to the weary and
despairing faces that met him on every side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, sir,&rsquo; said she enthusiastically, &lsquo;if
you could but get the men to listen to you, how much better it
would be for them!&nbsp; The poor fellows need a
friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Wentworth as if a ray of sunlight had suddenly
appeared.&nbsp; Naturally the young parson turned round to look
at the speaker; but, startled at her audacity, the beautiful girl
had suddenly disappeared, and the next face that met him wore a
very <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>different expression.&nbsp; If one face was a sunbeam
the other was a thundercloud.&nbsp; It was the face of the senior
deacon.&nbsp; For a long time after, however, the memory of that
fair girl&rsquo;s face haunted Wentworth as a dream.&nbsp; Seeing
that a storm was rising, he asked the senior deacon, in his
blandest tones, how he was.&nbsp; Harshly as a nutmeg-grater, the
senior deacon replied that he was as well as could be expected,
considering the state that the town was in.&nbsp; Severely
looking at the parson, he added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We missed you to-night, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, at the prayer meeting.&nbsp; I had intended to
be present, though.&nbsp; I find I made a sad mistake on the last
occasion.&nbsp; You know I called on Mr. B.&rsquo;&mdash;naming
one of the richest supporters of the chapel&mdash;&lsquo;to
engage in prayer, and what an unpleasant silence there was till
the pew-opener, coming up, whispered in my ear, &ldquo;Sir, Mr.
B. never prays,&rdquo; and I had to pray myself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said the senior deacon, &lsquo;we
have not all the same gifts; some can pray <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>in public,
others can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But you need not have kept away from
the meetin&rsquo; on that account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Wentworth, &lsquo;the truth was, I
had intended to be there, but I went to the Chartist meeting
instead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it seems, sir.&nbsp; You had not been there long
before we all heard of it.&nbsp; The news was over the town in a
very little while.&nbsp; I own it quite took away my
breath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which I am glad to find you have recovered by this
time,&rsquo; said the minister gaily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was not only
there, but I made a speech.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I heard, sir,&rsquo; said the deacon.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
suppose you think human applause more precious than seeking a
blessing on the means of grace.&nbsp; We, however, who did go,
had a blessed opportunity.&nbsp; We remembered you, sir, thought
it seems you forgot us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I think I was in the path of duty,
nevertheless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, sir,&rsquo; said the deacon in a very <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>unpleasant
tone of voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you make that out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, according to my idea.&nbsp; Chartism means
something, good or bad, and I thought I would go and see what it
meant.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the poor fellows had a good
deal of bad advice given them, and I thought I would try and give
them a little better.&nbsp; Their grievances are many, and so are
the wrongs which they have to bear.&nbsp; You know that it is in
consequence of the little sympathy that is shown them by the
Churches of all denominations these people are getting not only
to disbelieve Christianity, but to hate its very name.&nbsp; It
seemed to me that it was right that I should tell them as best I
could how they were mistaken in thus judging the Church.&nbsp; We
are losing the people, and then we call them infidels, and all
that is bad.&nbsp; I say, instead of doing this, we should seek
to win them by showing them how the Church is with them in their
struggle for their rights.&nbsp; If we are Christians, our <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>Christianity should display itself in our political
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the deacon with pride, &lsquo;all I
can say is that our late minister never attended a political
meeting in his life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to hear it,&rsquo; said Mr. Wentworth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; continued the deacon, not noticing the
interruption, &lsquo;and he died universally respected.&nbsp; He
never made an enemy.&nbsp; He was all things to all men.&nbsp;
Every Christmas morning and Good Friday he went to church, and it
was quite beautiful to see how humble and happy he looked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never interfere in politics,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am come here to preach the Gospel.&nbsp; I am not going
to impair my usefulness by becoming a political
partisan.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am sure,&rsquo; continued the deacon,
&lsquo;if he had forgotten this, and attended a Chartist meeting,
we should never have got the money from the gentry we did, when
we had the old meeting-house done up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Wentworth, &lsquo;he might have made
some of the Chartists Christians, and <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>that would have been better.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no use to get the meeting-house done up if the people
don&rsquo;t come into it.&nbsp; It seems to me such conduct as
you praise is the way to create the evils we deplore.&nbsp; In
the Saviour&rsquo;s time the common people heard the Gospel
gladly, and why should they not do so now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they won&rsquo;t, sir,&rsquo; said the deacon
angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because they are dead in trespasses and
sins; because they&rsquo;re regular heathens&mdash;a drinking,
swearing lot.&nbsp; Why, I should be ashamed to go near them, and
if some of them were to come to chapel, I believe the members
would leave the place at once.&nbsp; I am sure I
should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The senior deacon was a good man, but he had his
foibles.&nbsp; One of them was a due regard to his own worldly
good.&nbsp; Most of the neighbouring gentry came to his
shop.&nbsp; It was the best and the largest of the kind in the
town.&nbsp; What would become of his customers if his minister
went to a Chartist meeting?&nbsp; The thought was too horrible
for words.&nbsp; Hence the interview with the <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>parson, and
his disappearance from the streets of Sloville for many a long
day; not, however, till he gave a farewell address, which added
fuel to the fire, or, in other words, made his deacons more
implacable than ever.</p>
<h2><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN BOHEMIA.</span></h2>
<p>&lsquo;What a donkey I am!&rsquo; was the exclamation of a
tall, well-made young man, rather shabbily dressed&mdash;four or
five years after the events recorded in the preceding
chapter&mdash;as he stood clinging to a lamppost in Fleet Street
very late one bright summer night.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been to
Fairlop Fair, with instructions to do a gushing article, and
I&rsquo;m blessed if I can recollect anything about it, nor where
my notes are.&nbsp; I was to be back by ten, and it is now
midnight.&nbsp; Thank Heaven,&rsquo; continued the speaker, as he
groped into his coat pocket, &lsquo;my notes are there.&nbsp; I
thought I&rsquo;d left them behind in that bar-room where I was
waiting, where everyone was so <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>tight and so talkative.&nbsp;
Steady, boy&mdash;steady, boy!&rsquo; continued the speaker,
reluctantly depriving himself of the support of the
lamp-post.&nbsp; &lsquo;We shall be all right, and in time, after
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus summoning his energies, the individual in question
appeared to revive, and moved on with a gait ofttimes deviating
from the straight line, but not so much as to call for special
interference on the part of the police, and with that intense
expression which always accompanies a certain state of alcoholic
inspiration.</p>
<p>Diving down a side-street, he entered a door which seemed to
be open all night long, and which led to the very innermost
recesses of the <i>Daily Journal</i>.&nbsp; Giving a familiar nod
to the porter as he passed by, and steering for a room on an
upper floor, he took off his hat, sat himself down at a
writing-desk, lit his cigar, spread out a sheet of paper before
him, and took a pen in his hand.&nbsp; The furniture of the room
was of the barest description, and <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>mostly aimed at usefulness, rather
than show or comfort or luxury.&nbsp; There were two other men in
the room, but they took no notice of the new-comer, except to ask
him to be quiet, and not to kick up such a row.&nbsp; One was
gorgeously got up in evening dress.&nbsp; He had come from a
dinner at Willis&rsquo;s Rooms, with a Royal Duke in the
chair.&nbsp; The other was putting the final touch to a thrilling
description of a fire in the Seven Dials, accompanied by great
destruction of property and loss of life.</p>
<p>Thoroughly settling down to his work, the individual to whom I
have already drawn the attention of the reader took out his
note-book, and began studying its contents.&nbsp; At length,
unable to find what he wanted, he exclaimed somewhat
pettishly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where the dickens are my notes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, in your hat, to be sure, you old fool!&rsquo; said
one of the men, who, having finished his report, was preparing to
go home.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw you put them into your hat directly
you came in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; said the now sober <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>pressman,
looking into the last-named receptacle.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fact is,
I&rsquo;ve been lushing,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;a little too
much.&nbsp; Indeed, it was only as I went into the pub, and saw
the people, I could get up anything worth writing
about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, there is no reason to explain, my dear
fellow,&rsquo; replied the gentleman thus addressed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, but I wish you to understand I am the victim of
circumstances over which I had no control.&nbsp; It was business,
not love of liquor, which reduced me to this state.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; We all know you&rsquo;re as virtuous
as Father Mathew.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of
a small boy, sent by the sub-editor, to know if Mr. Wentworth was
in, as he was waiting for copy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell that respected gentleman,&rsquo; said the
individual thus alluded to, &lsquo;Mr. Wentworth is in, and in a
few minutes will let him have as much copy as he requires,&rsquo;
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>at the
same time handing the boy a few slips for the printers to go on
with.</p>
<p>The boy retired, and the speaker set to work, describing with
great felicity the revelry of the night, and deploring the
drunkenness which interfered with the pleasures of the day, and
which marred the beauties of the sylvan spot.&nbsp; By turns he
was humorous and moral, classical or romantic, and so effective
was the article that it was reprinted next day for gratuitous
circulation, and with a view to prevent the repetition of such
excesses on another occasion, by an &lsquo;Old Teetotaler&rsquo;
who lived in the neighbourhood of the revelry thus condemned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think that will fetch the public,&rsquo; said the
worthy proprietor of the <i>Daily Journal</i>, as he lingered
over the breakfast-table of his well-furnished mansion in an
aristocratic square next morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;That, my
dear,&rsquo; said he to his better-half, &lsquo;is just what the
British public likes&mdash;something light and airy, with a moral
tag at the end.&nbsp; We are a very high-souled people, and mere
flippancy <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>soon palls.&nbsp; I never had any fellow for the right
kind of article like poor MacAndrew.&nbsp; What a pity it is that
he drank himself to death!&nbsp; One would have thought he was
good for another ten years.&nbsp; As soon as he died we had quite
a drop in our sale; but since we have got the new hand the sale
has been steadily rising.&nbsp; Most of my writers are getting
too high and mighty, and think a great deal more of themselves
than the public do.&nbsp; But this new hand is more useful.&nbsp;
I fancy he is rather hard up.&nbsp; I know he drinks a good deal,
and as long as that is the case he will be glad to be on the
staff of the <i>Daily Journal</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the lady of the house, &lsquo;ask him
to our next soir&eacute;e.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d care to
come.&nbsp; The Cave of Harmony, or the Cider Cellars, is more in
his line, and, then, there are the girls.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not
have these fellows come here and make love to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No danger of that,&rsquo; said the proprietor&rsquo;s
lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;My daughters have been far too <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>well
brought up to fall in love with newspaper writers.&nbsp; It might
do in Paris, but not in London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear old girl,&rsquo; said the fond husband,
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve not got over the prejudices of early
education and the traditions of Minerva House.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
changed all that in these days, when illiterate young noblemen
make a living by scribbling scandals for the weekly journals, or
are found to appear as amateur performers, or, what is worse
still, on the real stage, jostling better men off, while the
tuft-hunters applaud and wise men swear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I am a little faulty,&rsquo; replied the
wife.&nbsp; Her father was an old-fashioned City merchant, whose
one standard of merit was wealth, and who thought his daughter
had quite forgotten herself when she fell in love with a man who
had anything to do with newspapers.&nbsp; &lsquo;At any rate, I
am sure I shall be glad to do what is civil to the poor fellow,
should you wish it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The poor fellow referred to was our old acquaintance&mdash;the
pious youth, the village <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>preacher, the brief occupant of the
pulpit in Sloville.&nbsp; Tottering home to his chambers at early
morn, he met a shabbily-dressed man whom he remembered as a
Fellow of King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge&mdash;a grand scholar,
and one of his old professors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re not got such a thing as a
half-crown to lend a fellow,&rsquo; said the ex-professor,
looking, unshorn and unwashed, particularly shady.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m drying of hunger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not; but if you come to my chambers in
Clifford&rsquo;s Inn we&rsquo;ll have a jolly good
breakfast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is needless to say that the invitation was accepted.&nbsp;
The bachelor&rsquo;s kettle was brought into play, and some good
coffee was made.&nbsp; Soon the room was fragrant with the scent
of Yarmouth bloaters, as they were being toasted, and after that
came a smoke and some chat.&nbsp; The feast, if not stately, was
satisfying, and the ex-professor, finding no more was to be had,
departed with lingering steps, leaving Wentworth to moralize, ere
he dropped <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>into the arms of Morpheus, upon the strange fate that
had reduced a man of such talent and standing to so low a
condition; and then he went off to sleep, to dream of his early
peaceful and happy home.&nbsp; That is what one never forgets, no
matter what may be his after-life.&nbsp; To the last each of us
may exclaim with Wordsworth:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My eyes are filled with childish tears,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart is idly stirred,<br />
And the same sounds are in my ears<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which in my youthful days I heard.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was well on towards noon when Wentworth woke up,
exclaiming:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, if life were a dream, and if dreams were life, what
happiness there would be for poor devils like myself!&nbsp; What
an infernal fool that old professor of mine has been!&nbsp; He
must have played his cards very badly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, reflecting that he was not much better himself, he
looked at the glass, and was astonished at his seedy
appearance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jove,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this will never
do,&rsquo; and hastily dressing himself, he rushed off <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>to
Hampstead Heath for a mouthful of fresh air.</p>
<p>Fleet Street saw no more of him that day.&nbsp; Goldsmith
tells us that, in all his foreign travel, he saw no finer view
than that he enjoyed from the top of Hampstead Heath, and the
view there is still fine, in spite of the damage done by the
smoke of London rising in the distance, and the hostile attacks
of that foe to the picturesque, the speculative builder.</p>
<p>On the Heath Wentworth met a fellow-reporter, looking as gay
and respectable as a rising barrister or successful
physician.&nbsp; He had his wife and children with him.&nbsp;
They nodded to each other, and the lady asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that shabby, seedy-looking fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, it is Wentworth, of the <i>Daily
Journal</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He looks very sad and miserable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; He is quite a man about town.&nbsp; I
fancy he drinks more than is good for him, and leads too fast a
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&lsquo;What a pity!&nbsp; Has he no friends to look
after him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe not.&nbsp; It is said he was brought up to be
a parson of some kind or other, but he gave it up.&nbsp; He has
plenty of ability, and would do well if he would settle down
quietly.&nbsp; But he will never do that.&nbsp; They tell me he
is quite a vagabond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ask him to lunch, and let us see what we can do to
reform him,&rsquo; said the lady, with the instinctive
tender-heartedness of her sex.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, he would not come if we did,&rsquo; and they
passed on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, there goes Tomlinson,&rsquo; said Wentworth to
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;How happy and respectable he looks!&nbsp;
They tell me he has saved quite a lot of money, and has quite a
nice little property about here.&nbsp; Such is destiny.&nbsp; He
was born under a lucky star, I under an unfortunate one.&nbsp;
Ah, if I had turned up trumps in matrimony, how different it
would have been!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus talking to himself, our hero found himself in the
neighbourhood of a well-known <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>inn, and a smile from the
barmaid&mdash;a showy specimen of her class&mdash;was quite
sufficient to induce him to enter.&nbsp; The fair creature, as
she said, &lsquo;was a little low, and wanted a fellow to talk
to.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wentworth soon rose to the occasion, and when he
left the hostelry, it was with a flushed cheek and a jaunty
air.&nbsp; Indeed, he was quite mirthful till he reached a little
cottage where he had spent many a riotous hour.&nbsp; To his
consternation, the blinds were down, and there was an unspeakable
air of desolation about the place, as if had come there the grim
unbidden visitor whose name is Death.&nbsp; He summoned enough
courage to enter, and came out, after a very short stay, looking
pale and sad.&nbsp; Death had indeed been there, and taken away
the breadwinner of the family, leaving wife and children
desolate.</p>
<p>It was late when he reached the rendezvous of his companions,
seedy fellows, but very happy, nevertheless, unshaven, with
rather big beards and long hair, much given <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>to smoking,
and not over-clean in person or linen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re late, young man,&rsquo; said the eldest of
the party, as Wentworth entered, &lsquo;and will have to stand
glasses all round.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly; but hear my excuse.&nbsp; I promised to be
here at eight; it is now ten.&nbsp; I want an S. and B.&nbsp; I
have not a rap in my pocket&mdash;absolutely cleared
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too bad! and yesterday was pay-day,&rsquo; said the
chairman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wentworth, you profligate, I am ashamed of
you.&nbsp; What an example you set these young people!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shocking, shocking!&rsquo; was the cry all round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strike, but hear,&rsquo; said Wentworth.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You know poor Canning?&rsquo; naming a comedian popular at
the music-halls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;s dead; and there&rsquo;s a wife and
five children, and an invalid aunt, without a halfpenny.&nbsp; I
happened to come by the cottage as I was coming here, and I never
saw a sadder sight.&nbsp; In one room the poor dead body; in
another, women in hysterics, <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>children weeping, and a vile harpy
of a landlady standing at the door wanting her money.&nbsp; I
paid her something to keep her quiet.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why
I&rsquo;m cleaned out, knowing that you generous youths would
give me something for the poor man&rsquo;s wife and
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Immediately every hand was put into its owner&rsquo;s pocket,
and Wentworth was content with the result, and he prepared to
enjoy himself after the fashion of the room, which was well
patronized by gentlemen of the press, including the dreariest of
shorthand writers and the most elegant of penny-a-liners.&nbsp;
As one went out to deliver his copy another came in who had done
so.&nbsp; The climax was reached when there came a gang of
Parliamentary reporters from the Gallery with the news of a great
division, a Ministerial defeat and a Parliamentary crisis, who
seemed inclined to sit up late talking shop.&nbsp; Most of them
had a cheerful glass, and when that is indulged in, it is
astonishing how witty a man becomes, and what a cause of wit in
other men.&nbsp; A good deal of profane <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>language
was used, and now and then a little Latin or a scrap of
Greek.&nbsp; The atmosphere was as critical as it was clouded
with tobacco.&nbsp; Wentworth took part in many a war of words,
and</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Drank delight of battle with his
peers.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sleepy waiter, reinforced by the sleepy landlord, had hard
work to clear the room, which, however, was not done till the
milkman might be heard going his early rounds, and the great
world of London was preparing for the business of the day.</p>
<p>No wonder Wentworth rather liked that sort of life.&nbsp; It
had for him the charm of novelty.&nbsp; At any rate, he breathed
a freer air than he had ever done before.&nbsp; He could say what
he meant.&nbsp; He had lived where that was impossible.&nbsp;
There was little free speech or thought in pious circles, either
Dissenting or Church, fifty years ago.&nbsp; Happily, the present
generation lives and moves in a freer day, when a man is not sent
to Coventry on account of honest <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>doubt.&nbsp; The one drawback he
felt was that he was rushing to the other extreme.</p>
<p>When Johnson was about to write the life of Akenside, he asked
Hannah More, as a friend of Sir James Stonehouse,
Akenside&rsquo;s contemporary at the now far-famed borough of
Northampton, if she could supply him with any information
concerning him.&nbsp; On which she tells us she made an effort to
recollect some sayings she had heard reported.&nbsp; This did not
suit the Doctor, who impatiently exclaimed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Incident, child&mdash;incident is what a biographer
wants.&nbsp; Did he break his leg?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great Doctor was but a superficial critic, after
all.&nbsp; As a rule, writers nowadays care little about
incident, and in this respect the public resembles them.&nbsp;
Given a life of average duration and condition, and we know its
inseparable incidents&mdash;incidents which are the general
property and experience of the human family.&nbsp; In our day we
like better to learn what is the hidden life&mdash;to see the
springs and sources of <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>action in the individual or the
community at large&mdash;what are the seeds sown in the human
heart, and what the fruit they bear.&nbsp; Nature works slowly
and in order, and miracles are, if not impossible, at any rate
rare.&nbsp; One can quite realize the feeling of the celebrated
Rammohun Roy, when he contended that miracles were not the part
of the Christian dispensation best adapted to the conversion of
sceptics.&nbsp; Be that as it may, there was nothing of the
miraculous in finding the ardent preacher of the Gospel now in
the camp of the scorner.&nbsp; That was the result of causes long
working unsuspected.&nbsp; He had been disgusted with the
narrowness of the Church and people with whom he had come in
contact.&nbsp; The God of his youth seemed to him hard, despotic,
unmerciful, and unlovely.&nbsp; He had been bowed down to the
earth with a great sorrow.&nbsp; Apparently the change was not
for good.&nbsp; Once he was a preacher; now he never darkened
church doors.&nbsp; Once he associated with the godly; now he did
nothing of the kind.&nbsp; In the language <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>of the
sects, now he was a son of perdition.</p>
<p>Of course a woman was at the bottom of it all.&nbsp; It was in
Hamburg they met.&nbsp; There was a fashionable English
boarding-school in that ancient city, and in the course of his
travels Wentworth had spent a winter there.&nbsp; Indeed, it was
on account of the beauty of one in particular that he had stopped
there wasting his time and getting over head and ears in
debt.&nbsp; It was all an accident; going up the old Steinweg, he
had seen some of the young ladies of the English school coming
down.&nbsp; One of them was Ad&egrave;le, blue-eyed, fresh and
fair as the stars on a summer night.&nbsp; Their eyes met, and
Wentworth was over head and ears in love.</p>
<p>In a little while he managed to make the acquaintance of the
lady at an evening party, where everyone was ravished with her
musical genius.&nbsp; He was introduced to her, and found her
English charming.&nbsp; It was evident that immense pains had
been taken with her education.&nbsp; He had <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>never met
so brilliant a linguist before, French, German, Italian,
English&mdash;in all she was equally at home.&nbsp; Again, he had
met her at a f&ecirc;te without the gates, and had the honour of
escorting her home.&nbsp; In a little while he had sent her a
letter of which it is needless to describe the contents.&nbsp;
That letter was placed in her guardian&rsquo;s hands, and the
result was an interview and a betrothal.</p>
<p>Had our hero been equal to the situation, had he had a proper
amount of backbone, had he not been trained to lead an emotional
life, had he attained to the true dignity of manhood, he either
would have never thought of love of one in every way so much
superior, or he would have returned to England at once to fight
the battle of life for himself and to fit him for her.&nbsp;
Alas! he was weak and intoxicated with love, hardly master of
himself.&nbsp; He fell into bad society with men richer than
himself, where he learned to drink and live recklessly.&nbsp;
Away from her, loving her with the intensest and wildest passion,
he was <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>utterly miserable.&nbsp; He returned to London, and got
a little work to do in the way of reviewing.</p>
<p>In London he was worse off than in Hamburg.&nbsp; His mode of
life lent itself easily to the wildest excesses.&nbsp; Had he
brought back the lady with him as his wife it would have been
otherwise.&nbsp; His was a nature that could not stand alone.</p>
<p>Some of his wealthy friends had married, and at their evening
soir&eacute;es he met men and women&mdash;authors, artists,
statesmen, men of progress, men and women whose names the world
yet gratefully remembers; and then away he would rush off to the
lodgings of other friends&mdash;dissipated medical students as
they were in those far-off days, types of the Bob Sawyer class,
and with gin-and-water would pass the night, unless, as was too
frequently the case, they plunged into the debaucheries of London
by night, when respectability had gone to bed.</p>
<p>Lower and lower did Wentworth fall, and then came the
end.&nbsp; The lady discovered how romantic had been her dream,
and the <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>dismissed lover staggered under the blow.&nbsp; It is
hard to realise what a moral wreck that pitiable wretch had
become&mdash;how with no real excuse for his drink and
dissipation, now almost a necessity of his life, all hope had
vanished from his horizon, all faith in God or man.</p>
<p>For a time he led, as many do, a dual life&mdash;decent by
day, the reverse by night.&nbsp; London is full of such men
now.&nbsp; Fathers and mothers living far away in the quiet
country home have no idea what London is by night, or was, for I
write of a wild scene of dissipation which no longer
exists.&nbsp; A young man in business is sheltered more or less
from the lowest abysses of London life.&nbsp; A young man in a
decent home is also guarded to a certain extent.&nbsp; It is the
stranger within the gates who, as a rule, falls the more easily
to the allurements of vice.&nbsp; He is alone; he needs
society.&nbsp; It is not good for man to be alone.&nbsp; If a man
cannot have good society, the chances are he will have bad.</p>
<p>The Church at one time made no effort <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>to bring
back such lost ones.&nbsp; They drew a hard and fast line.&nbsp;
They only admitted the hypocrite or the saint.&nbsp; Wentworth
belonged to neither class.&nbsp; In reality he had little
altered.&nbsp; He left religious society because he could not
with an honest conscience conform to its ideas, or speak its
language, or adopt its conventionalisms.&nbsp; At one time he
believed in it because he had been brought up in it.&nbsp; He had
been taught phrases, and he used them without ever thinking of
their meaning, and when the meaning did not come he went on using
them, believing it would come.&nbsp; &lsquo;Preach faith till you
have it,&rsquo; said an old divine to a young brother, &lsquo;and
then you will preach it because you have it.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
Wentworth&rsquo;s case the remedy did not answer.&nbsp; He
preached because he thought it his duty.&nbsp; He did not preach
because he felt it dishonesty to use terms of doubtful meaning
utilized in the pulpit in one sense, understood in the pew in
another.&nbsp; He had not found light in Little Bethel or Cave
Adullam.&nbsp; Was it to be found elsewhere, <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>in the
gaiety and dissipation of the world?&nbsp; Well, that was what he
wanted to find out for himself.&nbsp; Like most of us, Wentworth
was too impatient, and could not wait for the happy surrounding
which comes to all true men soon or late.&nbsp; Religious people
and he had parted.&nbsp; It seemed to him as if he could do no
good, and as if the attempt to do so were harm.&nbsp; He had
aimed high and fallen low.&nbsp; To save himself from starvation
he did a little literary work, but that was a poor staff on which
to lean.&nbsp; He had, as most of us have, daily wants, and, to
meet them, required daily cash.</p>
<p>Turning one night into a tavern, he found two or three
seedy-looking men manufacturing what they called
&lsquo;flimsy&rsquo; for one of the dailies.&nbsp; They took pity
on him, and taught him how to do the same.&nbsp; For a time he
was their assistant, and they gave him a share of the pay; but
evil communications corrupt good manners, and, to drown all
thought, he did as they did: sat up late in
public-houses&mdash;these latter places kept open nearly all
night then&mdash;and the <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>excitement of the new life came to
him as a pleasurable relief from the darkness which had cast a
gloom on the morning of his days.</p>
<p>It became in time a habit with him to spend his nights in the
music-halls, such as the Cider Cellars and Evans&rsquo;s, which
now have long ceased to exist, where he could forget what he once
was, and did not think of what he once hoped to be.&nbsp; At such
places all classes met in boon companionship&mdash;the lord and
the lout, the drunken clergyman, the greenhorn from the country,
the man of business, or county magistrate, or attorney up in town
for a day or two and anxious to see life, the wild sawbones, who
was supposed by his anxious parents far away to be walking the
hospitals and fitting himself for a useful career, reporters,
students, barristers, reckless men of all kinds, over whom
tailors and landlords alike grieved.&nbsp; Then there were haunts
still more infamous, frequented by women as reckless and
abandoned as the men.&nbsp; Some had seen better days; some had
<a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>loved,
and been betrayed and abandoned; some had never known virtue in
any shape; all on their way down to be trodden underfoot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was gay myself once,&rsquo; says many a man of the
world, as he hears of the excesses of dissipation.&nbsp; Alas! so
much the worse for him.&nbsp; It is true all experience makes a
man, in one sense, wiser, if he be a wise man.&nbsp; Yet it is a
solemn truth that no tears, no penitence, no prayers, no
exertions of an after-life, can restore to the sensualist or the
profligate the bloom, the freshness and purity of early
youth.&nbsp; None of us can blot out the past.&nbsp; The joyous
aspect of innocence and grace can never be recalled, though, for
all who seek it, there is a Divine mercy, lasting as eternity,
broad as heaven itself.</p>
<p>At one time the idea of being in such company would have been
shocking to Wentworth.&nbsp; There are thousands who, however,
thus do fall away.&nbsp; But they do so little by little.&nbsp;
No one suddenly becomes base, said the Latin moralist, and he <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>is
right.&nbsp; A real friend or two might have saved Wentworth many
a bitter hour.&nbsp; But at that time the thing was
impracticable.&nbsp; The line of demarcation between the Church
and the world was too strictly drawn.&nbsp; In the parable of the
Great Teacher, the tares and the wheat grew side by side.&nbsp;
In its superior wisdom, the Church undertook to pull up and get
rid of the tares, but in doing so a good deal of mischief was
done.&nbsp; There was no halting between two opinions.&nbsp; You
were either converted or not.&nbsp; A man was either the child of
God or of the devil.&nbsp; The Church held up an impossible and
an unlovely Christianity, into the belief of which men and women
were terrified..&nbsp; To produce that effect there was no end of
excitement, and then, when the excitement was over, in too many
cases came the inevitable relapse.&nbsp; One result of this was
that the victim had to look elsewhere for the excitement which
had become part and parcel of his being&mdash;to the flowing
bowl, to what is called jolly companionship, to the siren voice
of worldly pleasure&mdash;and the novice falls too easily a <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>prey.&nbsp;
Abelard is a more common character than Simeon Stylites.&nbsp;
The songs of Circe are pleasant to listen to, and there are roses
and raptures for the sinner as well as the saint, and the roses
and raptures are now&mdash;not in a world to come.&nbsp; The
world has a great fascination for a lad brought up in a pious
home, to whom it has been represented as a waste howling
wilderness, peopled with devils fearful to gaze on.&nbsp; When he
steps into it, and finds how unfairly it has been drawn to him by
the Church, the chance is that he runs to the other
extreme.&nbsp; We have hardly yet emancipated ourselves from the
morbid and monkish theology of the Romish Church.&nbsp; There
come to the writer sad recollections of a dismal theology to
which he was expected to give his assent.&nbsp; Never did men
then talk of man being made in the image of his Maker&mdash;of
his being vicegerent of the earth, only a little lower than the
angels, covered with glory and honour.&nbsp; All was devilish man
could say or do.&nbsp; In vain was education, or science, or
art.&nbsp; The cleverer, the more <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>useful, the more decent you were,
the more mischievous, the further from God.</p>
<p>Such was the doctrine preached from a thousand pulpits, at any
rate, not many years since.&nbsp; And thus it was that the
churches were chiefly filled with ignorant women and old men, or
with young people&mdash;who died early of consumption&mdash;who
accepted everything they heard in the pulpit, who knew nothing of
the world they denounced, to whom the language of passion and
temptation was unknown.&nbsp; It is easy to be religious when all
that is irreligious has worked itself out of the man&mdash;to
lead a dull, decent, formal life, when the capacity for excess is
gone, or the spendthrift has been turned into a miser; when old
age has taken from woman her power to tempt, and robbed the
wine-cup of its fascination; when all a man wants is an
easy-chair by a good fire.&nbsp; When we cry with Tennyson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ruined trunks on withered forks,<br />
Empty scarecrows, I and you.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is not everyone who cares for such companionship.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&lsquo;Where are my dead forefathers?&rsquo; asked the
pagan Frisian of Bishop Wolfran, as he stood with one of his
royal leg&rsquo;s in the baptismal font.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In hell with all the other unbelievers,&rsquo; was the
reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mighty well!&rsquo; exclaimed Radbrod, removing his
leg.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I will rather feast with my ancestors in
the halls of Woden, than dwell with your little starveling band
of Christians in heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to Wentworth.&nbsp; He was disappointed, not only as
regards the ministry, but as regards love, and that is a yet more
awful thing.&nbsp; Plotinus taught that God made women beautiful
that by means of them men might be drawn to love a beauty that is
divine.&nbsp; To one capable of strong affection no blow can be
more terrible than that of a disappointed love.&nbsp; It is vain
to doubt on the subject.&nbsp; To all human appearances Wentworth
was lost, but God never leaves a man to fall away for ever.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A gracious hand,&rsquo; writes the pious Wilberforce,
&lsquo;leads us in ways we know not, not <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>only with,
but against our plans and inclinations.&rsquo;&nbsp; Happily,
this was so in Wentworth&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; There came to him
strength to reform, to conquer himself, to rise out of his dead
self to something higher and better, partly from the memory of a
pious home, partly by the natural working of his soul, partly by
the needs of daily life, partly and chiefly by contact with an
actress, who reproached him with his idleness and want of energy
and aimlessness.&nbsp; Both were Bohemians, but the woman
supported herself and her widowed mother.&nbsp; Both had loved
and lost, both had found the ways of transgressors hard, that
pleasure is not happiness, that there is no way to escape from
God&rsquo;s universal law, that wrongdoing, in thought or word or
deed, is never without its inseparable penalty, and that is, the
worm that dieth not, the fire that is not quenched.&nbsp; You may
forget much, but you can never forget, if you live till the age
of Methuselah, what you have done inconsistent with the native
nobility of man; if you have brought dishonour on your name, <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>betrayed
the right, trifled with a woman&rsquo;s heart, brought the gray
hairs of father or mother to the grave with sorrow.&nbsp; The
memory of such acts will continue, and sting and torture as long
as life and though and being last.&nbsp; For such a one there are
no waters of Lethe, cry for them as he will.&nbsp; A man cannot
hide himself from himself.&nbsp; He may deceive the world; he may
lead a life of pleasure; but he cannot deceive himself, however
he may try to do so.&nbsp; Alone in the stillness of the night,
in the quiet of the sick-room, in the awful presence of death,
conscience will speak, and he cannot stifle its voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Be sure your sin will find you out&rsquo; is the teaching
of all daily life.&nbsp; To be happy even in this world, as old
Franklin found out, you must be virtuous.&nbsp; It is a false
creed, that which makes us believe that man is better without God
than with Him&mdash;better as a vicious than a virtuous
man&mdash;better as a mild Agnostic or a gay infidel than a
decent, sober Christian.</p>
<p>The home training in evangelical circles <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>fifty years
ago had many serious defects.&nbsp; It was conducted too much
with reference to the future world rather than the present
one.&nbsp; Had Wentworth been taught the beauty of
work&mdash;that life was a battlefield in which the victory was
to the strong&mdash;that man was here to do the best he could for
himself, to enjoy the world which the good God had made
beautiful&mdash;that he was to aim high, to cherish noble
expectations, to do manly deeds, to be true and honest and
courageous, how different would have been his life!&nbsp; Only
the emotional part of him had been developed, and he fell an easy
prey when temptation came to him and the voice of passion
thundered in his ear and he fell.&nbsp; Why should he not, as he
grew tired of sinning and repenting, he asked himself, ignore the
past and find peace where peace could never be found?&nbsp; He
would eat of the grapes of Sodom and the clusters of
Gomorrah.&nbsp; He would sit in the seat of the scorner.&nbsp;
There, at any rate, conscience would cease to sting.&nbsp; It was
the <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>old
story over again.&nbsp; <i>Facilis descensus Averni</i>.</p>
<p>Wentworth was beginning to find this out.&nbsp; He had eaten
of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, as all
must do&mdash;though some more than others&mdash;and he had found
it fairer to the eye than pleasant to the palate.&nbsp; He was
getting sick of worldly men and worldly things.&nbsp; There is a
cant of the world as well as of the Church, and he had found it
out.&nbsp; The cloud passed away, and then came to him a clearer
spiritual insight than he had ever possessed before.&nbsp; He had
lost the childish faith of his early home, and there came in its
stead the grander and fuller one of a man who had put away
childish things, who had fought his fears and gathered strength,
who had fought his fears and gathered strength, who had found
peace and safety, not in the pleasant places, gay with flowers
and musical with the song of birds, where we never dream of
danger, but in the storm and tempest of the raging sea.&nbsp; Old
ideas, modified by hard experience, asserted themselves; old
inspirations were revived; old <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>hopes and purposes were brought to
life.&nbsp; He would be a preacher&mdash;but from the press,
rather than from the more cramped and circumscribed pulpit.&nbsp;
Temporal things also went better with him.&nbsp; Some of his
writings had been republished, and had brought him fame and
fortune.&nbsp; In the accomplished actress of the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane, known as Miss Howard, he had met a sympathetic
friend.&nbsp; It was she who had originally raised him from the
Slough of Despond, and had recalled him to his better self.</p>
<p>It is told of an Indian Prince who in prosperity was too much
elevated and in adversity too much depressed, that he gave notice
that on his forthcoming birthday the most acceptable present that
any of his courtiers could make him would be a sentence short
enough to be engraved on a ring, and suggesting a remedy for the
grievance of which he complained.&nbsp; Many phrases were
accordingly proposed, but not one was deemed satisfactory, till
his daughter came forward and offered <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>an emerald on which were engraved
two Arabic words, the literal translation of which was,
&lsquo;This, too, will pass.&rsquo;&nbsp; Warren Hastings, who
told the story, adds how the sentence cheered him when on his
trial in Westminster Hall.&nbsp; It was thus Wentworth was
upheld, and &lsquo;This, too, will pass&rsquo; was the thought
that urged him on.</p>
<h2><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE OLD, OLD STORY.</span></h2>
<p>Once upon a time there was a sad hubbub in the Independent
Chapel at Sloville.&nbsp; At the monthly tea-meeting of the
teachers the prettiest of the female teachers was missing, much
to the grief of the young men, and to the relief of some plain
but pious young women, who had been rather in the shade since she
had come amongst them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Rose Wilcox?&rsquo; was the universal
query.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s give up religion, and gone off to the
Church, I suppose,&rsquo; said the senior deacon, who was
president on the occasion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear it is worse than that,&rsquo; whispered a young
female teacher, who, as the neighbour of the missing Rose, was
supposed to <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>know more of her movements than anyone else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say I am surprised; indeed, I may say it
is only what I expected,&rsquo; continued the senior deacon,
&lsquo;considering how frivolous she was, and how little her
family availed themselves of the means of grace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The senior deacon&rsquo;s words commended themselves to
all.&nbsp; Rose Wilcox was volatile.&nbsp; She was at that
critical age when most pretty girls are so&mdash;a time of life
always severely criticised by those who have passed it, or who
have been preserved by kindly circumstances from its many
dangers, and who ignore the godly and humane advice of Burns:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Then gently scan your brother Man,<br />
Still gentler sister Woman.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rose thus criticised was, perhaps, the prettiest girl in
all the town.&nbsp; Her father had been an officer in the navy,
who had married for love a wife who had nothing to give him but a
pretty face and a loving heart.&nbsp; For a time they lived <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>humbly but
comfortably on his half-pay.&nbsp; They had two children, a son
and a daughter.&nbsp; The former grew up wild and wayward, and
was a sad trouble to the family on the occasion of his visits on
shore; for he was a sailor, like his father.&nbsp; Rose was her
father&rsquo;s companion.&nbsp; He taught her all that he knew
himself: to read Shakespeare; to get a smattering of French; to
play a little on the piano.&nbsp; But he became involved in debt
through becoming a surety for an old friend who had no one else
to stand between him and impending ruin, and that friend, alas!
left him in the lurch, or, in other words, handed him over to his
creditors, and he died broken-hearted, leaving his wife and
daughter almost penniless and friendless.&nbsp; The mother then
moved to Sloville, where she managed, with the assistance of her
daughter, to secure a scanty living as milliner and
dressmaker&mdash;a calling which she had followed before she
became a wife, and where, almost to her alarm and at the same
time much to her pride, she beheld <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>her daughter grow handsomer and
lovelier every day.</p>
<p>The Sloville people said Rose was the prettiest girl in the
town, and they were right.&nbsp; The landlord of the leading
hotel would have given anything to have secured her services at
the bar.&nbsp; The snobs of the place were much given to pester
her with their impertinence, while lads of a lower grade
inundated her with valentines and poetical effusions, as amorous
as they were ill-spelt and badly written; and gay Lotharios in
the shape of commercials, far removed from the chastening
influences of their own lawful spouses, said to her all sorts of
silly things on their occasional visits to the town and her
mother&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>As the world goes, this was not much to be wondered at.&nbsp;
Even in the good houses round the Park, where all the best
families lived, and where carriage company was kept, it was to be
questioned whether any more attractive young lady could be found
than Rose, in spite of the plainness of her dress and the humble
drudgery of her daily life.&nbsp; <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>In no conservatory in that part of
the world were to be seen fairer roses than those which adorned
her cheeks.&nbsp; Her profile was exquisitely classical; her
every action graceful.&nbsp; No lady in the town had such a head
of rich brown hair, none so downy a cheek of loveliest pink, none
a blue eye so lustrous or sparkling, none a more melodious
voice.&nbsp; Many a Belgravian maiden would have given a fortune
to have had a hand as delicately formed, a waist as tempting, a
step as elastic, a figure as fair, a carriage as superb, a smile
as irresistible.</p>
<p>Personal advantages, declaim against them as we
will&mdash;though why we should do so I know not, since they are
the gift of God, and not to be bought with hard cash&mdash;are of
inestimable value to a woman.&nbsp; It is no use arguing with a
jury, Serjeant Ballantine tells us, when the plaintiff or
defendant, as the case may be, is a pretty woman, and that it was
the same in the time of the Athenians the case of Phryne is an
illustration.&nbsp; Is it not Balzac who tells us that the
faintest whisper of a pretty <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>woman is louder than the
trumpet-call of duty?&nbsp; Nevertheless, a poor girl whose only
dower is her beauty finds it often a perilous gift.&nbsp; Indeed,
it was owing to this very possession that poor Rose had the world
at a disadvantage.&nbsp; She had been spoilt by an indulgent
father, and her fond mother was little fitted to act the part of
a guide, philosopher, and friend in the perplexities and
temptations of real life.&nbsp; Her brother was of no avail, as
when at sea he was too far away, and when on shore he had shown a
thoughtlessness and heedlessness which made him a burden rather
than a help.</p>
<p>It was not true that she had given up religion, as was
indicated by some of her associates; the fact was she had none to
give up worth speaking of.&nbsp; She had gone to chapel with her
mother as a matter of course, and being intelligent and
good-natured and willing to be useful, she had been worked into
the Sunday-school.&nbsp; It was interesting to her to teach the
young idea how to shoot, and she was fond of <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>children,
and so she went as a Sunday-school teacher.&nbsp; She had left
the chapel because it was dark and dull; because the people were
censorious and hard; because the service was uninteresting;
because the preacher was always full of the Jews and the
prophecies, and seemed to have no idea of life as she saw it
around her, and was perpetually railing at a world which seemed
to her so bright and fair; because in her heart, as in that of
most of us at her age, there was a love of pleasure, impetuous
and impatient of control.</p>
<p>Nor was it true that she had gone to church, as intimated
above.&nbsp; The fact was, she had summoned up her energies for
an awful step for anyone to take: she had run away from poverty,
and hard work, and privation, and discomfort, and wretchedness,
in the hope and belief&mdash;alas! too rudely to be
shaken&mdash;that henceforth there was to be perpetual sunshine
in her path, and perpetual joy in her heart.</p>
<p>We are all of us too ready to fancy that grapes grow on
thorns, and Rose was no <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>exception to the general rule.&nbsp;
She had never read Wordsworth, and perhaps if she had she would
not have understood that grand ode, though the knowledge did
painfully come to her in after-life, where he invokes Duty as
stern daughter of the voice of God:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Who art a light to guide, a rod<br />
To check the erring and reprove;<br />
Thou who art victory and law<br />
When empty terrors overawe;<br />
From vain temptations dost set free<br />
And calm&rsquo;st the weary strife of frail humanity.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At home for a long time she had been disappointed at her
lot.&nbsp; She was getting tired of hard work and humble fare,
ignorant of the fact that God gives us what is best for us, and
that His wisdom is as omnipotent as His love.&nbsp; She had no
companions to guide her aright, and was tired of the awkward
admiration of the homely and lubberly lads with whom she came in
contact.&nbsp; She had taken to reading trashy novels, which had
not merely amused her, but filled her head with nonsense.&nbsp;
Greedily she drank in all their poison.&nbsp; Little by little
they broke <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>down all the defences of her common-sense, as she read
of splendid marriages made by simple village girls, of runaway
matches, of wonderful elopements.&nbsp; They taught her how
pleasure was the supreme good, how true happiness consisted in
having wealth, in riding in a brougham, in being dressed in silks
and satins, in wearing diamonds, in going to grand balls; in
short, in realizing what at the meeting-house had been pretty
plainly denounced as the pleasures of sin for a season.</p>
<p>The more the poor girl reasoned on her condition the harder to
her it seemed to be.&nbsp; It must be false what the parsons
said; people who had money, who lived sumptuously, who were
arrayed in purple and fine linen, must be happy&mdash;as she
herself was when she had a crown-piece in her pocket, a dress a
little smarter than usual, or a bonnet of the latest
fashion.&nbsp; There was the senior deacon, who more fond of
money than he? though he always called it dross and filthy
lucre.&nbsp; Then there were the senior deacon&rsquo;s daughters
and wife; <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>did not they always look a little more amiable when
they had new clothes on?&nbsp; There was the old parson himself;
did not everyone laugh at him because he was poor and shabby, and
had not his long life of poverty reduced him to such a state that
he could not say &lsquo;Bo!&rsquo; to a goose?&nbsp; Money meant
health, and happiness, and honour, and power; that was
clear.&nbsp; Why, the wickedest men in the town, who had money,
were made more of than the old parson, who had never done harm to
anyone, and whose long record was unsullied.&nbsp; Naturally,
this sort of reasoning made the poor girl a little discontented
and out of sorts.</p>
<p>At times she had all the youthful recklessness of her sex, and
not a little was her mother terrified.&nbsp; A father or a
brother might have taught her a little common-sense, but her only
confidante was her mother&mdash;as fond as she was
foolish&mdash;who felt herself that her daughter had a smile as
sunny, a carriage as graceful, an air as distinguished, and a
birth as gentle, as any <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>of the leaders of society in
Sloville.&nbsp; She always insisted on her daughter&rsquo;s
fitness for something higher.&nbsp; Love levels all distinctions
of rank, and Rose herself was half a Radical&mdash;at any rate,
much more of one than pretty women generally are.&nbsp; She was
also ambitious.&nbsp; She had a charming voice, and danced
well.&nbsp; Why should she not shine in society?&nbsp; Why should
not she be the star of the ball-room and the theatre?&nbsp; Why
should not she have a brougham and drive in the parks?&nbsp; Why
should not the men fall down and worship at her shrine?&nbsp;
Beauty had a magic power, and wonders were ever being performed
daily by the sorcery of Love.&nbsp; Did not King Cophetua take a
beggar-maid to be his queen?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be a lady yet,&rsquo; said the silly girl;
&lsquo;I am tired of stitching and sewing from morn to night; I
am tired of this dull street and this dull town; I&rsquo;ll be a
lady yet, mother,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and you shall come and
live with me in a fine house in town with plenty of servants to
wait on us and real nice dinners to eat.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&lsquo;Nonsense, girl!&rsquo; said the mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You had better marry the deacon&rsquo;s shopman; he is
very fond of you, and I am sure, by this time, he could furnish a
house well and keep a wife comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, as the individual in question was as fat as a porpoise,
and very much the shape of one; as his manners were as plebeian
as his appearance, and as he never had anything to say for
himself, Rose regarded him with infinite disgust, and vowed
she&rsquo;d rather go into a nunnery or die an old maid.</p>
<p>On the night of the Chartist meeting already referred to, Rose
was met by the individual in question, and as there were so many
people about, Rose graciously accepted the offer of his arm to
take her home, much to his delight and joy.&nbsp; He determined
to make the best of his chance.&nbsp; There are some men who take
an ell when you give them an inch.&nbsp; Rose&rsquo;s rustic
admirer belonged to this class.</p>
<p>Rose became alarmed at his amorous attention, and
screamed.&nbsp; That scream was <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>heard by a gentleman,
Sloville&rsquo;s only baronet, the lord of the manor, as he was
riding past in his brougham.&nbsp; By the clear moonlight he saw
that the girl who stood trembling before him was the girl whose
face had haunted his dreams since he first caught sight of her in
Sloville, and in pursuit of whom he had scoured the town like a
hawk ever since.&nbsp; He had caught sight of her for a moment at
the Chartist meeting, and here she was actually in his power, and
needing his aid!&nbsp; How he blessed his stars, as eagerly, with
the most polished air, he offered to drive Rose home.&nbsp; At
first she hesitated, as was natural.&nbsp; If she would get
inside, he would mount the box and drive.</p>
<p>Rose accepted his offer; there could be no harm in that,
though she would not allow the brougham to come nearer her home
than the top of the street in which she lived, for fear of
scandal.&nbsp; She accepted the offer, partly because she wished
for the sensation of riding in a brougham like a real lady, and
partly because <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>of her anxiety to get rid of her loutish lover.&nbsp;
Perhaps it had been as well if Rose had ridden up to the door in
the brougham, or had refused the offer of it altogether.&nbsp; As
it was, she got out, and the driver of the brougham would not
allow her to go home alone.&nbsp; If he was proud as Lucifer, he
was subtle as the serpent that tempted Eve.&nbsp; She could not
refuse his offer of guardianship, his appearance was so handsome,
and his manner so polished and flattering and deferential.&nbsp;
Surely he could not do her any harm.&nbsp; The offer was one she
had not sufficient self-denial to repel as she ought to have
done, as any well-regulated young lady in superior circles of
course would have done.</p>
<p>Alas! Rose was but a poor dressmaker, barely eighteen, an age
when to the young woman clings a good deal of the romantic folly
of the girl.&nbsp; She was the pride of an indulgent mother who
never restrained her little whims, and whose scanty means
afforded but little relief to the dull monotony of her daily
life.&nbsp; Rose, of course, was in her seventh heaven.&nbsp; <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Her hour of
triumph and reward had arrived.&nbsp; Here was the prince who had
come to marry the beggar&rsquo;s daughter; the gallant knight who
was to lead her out of the prison house of poverty, to reveal to
her all the glories of a world which, after all, looks best at a
distance.</p>
<p>There is a tide in the affairs of women as well as men, which,
taken at the flood, leads on to fortune, and Rose believed that
the tide was now in her favour.&nbsp; Here was the chance for
which she had been dreaming, for which she had been prepared by a
due course of silly novel-reading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A tall, dark gentleman is in love with you,&rsquo; said
the gipsy whom Rose had last consulted on the subject.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He will come to you when you least expect it.&nbsp; He is
immensely rich, and will make you handsome presents.&nbsp; He
will take you to London, where he will marry you, and you shall
have horses and carriages, and servants, and music, and wine, and
balls, and will live happy ever after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tall, dark gentleman had come, and <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>he had
fallen in love with her.&nbsp; It amused him in that dull town to
have an affair of this kind on hand.&nbsp; It gave a new zest to
his <i>blas&eacute;</i> life; the only things he cared for were
pretty faces, and he had spent his life ever since leaving Oxford
in search of them.&nbsp; Now that he had come to the family
estate and title; now that he was Sir Watkin Strahan, of Elm
Court, it is not to be presumed that there was any diminution of
zeal in his search; on the contrary, he pushed it with more zest
than ever.&nbsp; In the language of his friends, he was a devil
of a fellow for women, and it was clear to him that this young
rustic beauty would soon fall an easy prey.</p>
<p>The chances were all in favour of the execution of his wicked
design, for he was a cruel man, in spite of his youth and
handsome face and figure, a polished gentleman, yet venomous and
dangerous as a cobra or a wolf.&nbsp; He was now given up to one
pursuit, the ruin of this fair young girl, on whom, in an evil
moment, he had cast a longing eye; and poor Rose thought him a <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>model
gentleman!&nbsp; He had no scruples of conscience when his fancy
was aroused.&nbsp; All he cared for, all he thought of, was
himself.&nbsp; Pleasure was to be had, regardless of the cost to
himself, of the misery to others.&nbsp; In a rich and old
community like ours the number of such men is immense, and the
mischief they do no tongue can tell.&nbsp; In our streets by
night we see the ruin they have wrought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am mad after that girl,&rsquo; said Sir Watkin to a
friend one day.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have made her presents of all
kinds; I have followed up every chance; I have promised even to
marry her, and yet she keeps me at arm&rsquo;s length.&nbsp; She
is a regular Penelope.&nbsp; It seems years since I first saw
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; said his friend&mdash;an old rake of
the Regency, to whom all women were mere childish
toys&mdash;&lsquo;she can&rsquo;t resist you.&nbsp; You are bound
to win her.&nbsp; She is only a little more artful than others of
her class.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it were so.&nbsp; I almost despair; and that
makes me the more determined she shall be mine.&nbsp; I was never
disappointed yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&lsquo;Courage, mon ami,&rsquo; was the reply.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Such a little beauty is not to be caught in a day.&nbsp;
Take the advice of an old soldier.&nbsp; You are too
cautious.&nbsp; You must carry her by a grand <i>coup de
main</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas! an opportunity soon occurred.&nbsp; There was to be a
grand horse-race a few miles off.&nbsp; Rose had never seen one,
and wished to go.&nbsp; She had let herself be taken there by the
Baronet.&nbsp; She was very sorry she had agreed to the
arrangement, but it was too late to draw back, and she made an
excuse to her mother for her temporary absence.&nbsp; After the
race there was a grand dinner, followed by a ball.&nbsp; The poor
girl had hardly the heart to refuse, and, indeed, she was too far
from home to go back alone, though the agreement was that she was
to be taken back immediately the race was over.&nbsp; This part
of the programme the Baronet never intended to put in execution,
and he made some excuse or other for its non-fulfilment, which
she was obliged to accept.&nbsp; Off her guard with excitement
and wine yet not without misgivings of heart, she was <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>persuaded
to accompany the party back to London.&nbsp; In her sober moments
she would never have done such a thing, but she was surrounded by
men and women who laughed at her scruples and overcame her
objections.&nbsp; Hardly knowing what she was about, she&mdash;a
dove, innocent and unprotected&mdash;was borne by the vultures to
town.</p>
<p>For the first time she had tasted of the charmed cup, and she
found it pleasant.&nbsp; She felt sorry for her mother, to whom
she wrote a hasty note, but without giving her any address,
telling her not to be alarmed at her absence, stating that she
was staying with some kind friends, and that she would soon let
her know further particulars, which she felt sure would please
her.&nbsp; She was to stay at the house of a real lady, who was
to take her to see all the grand sights of the town.&nbsp; Her
spirits rose to the occasion, and, dressed magnificently in the
latest fashions, she found some kind of enjoyment in the gay
company she kept, in riding in a brougham, in going to the
theatre and the opera, in finding herself in a new world, <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>where she
was received with a favour never extended to her in the tamer
circles of Sloville.&nbsp; She felt that she had made a wonderful
start in the world, and how wrong were they who spoke of its
pleasures as transitory and of little worth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was the world for her,&rsquo; said the Baronet,
whose demeanour was at times most kind and considerate, and who
treated her with the respect due from a gentleman to a lady,
though occasionally he assumed a boldness which brought the hot
blood to her cheek and filled her with alarm.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, it is said, an old Scotch beadle, with the
astute utterance of his class, went a-courting.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Jeannie,&rsquo; said he, as he took the object of his
affection into the parochial cemetery, and pointed to some graves
in a remote corner, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s whaur my people
lie.&nbsp; Would ye like to lie with them?&rsquo;&nbsp; Jeannie
answered in the affirmative, and the happy pair soon became man
and wife.&nbsp; In the same way the Baronet threw open to the
dazzled eyes of this fatherless country girl all the usual <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>resorts of
the gay world in all their pomp and glory, and she was delighted,
as she had not the experience to tell her how much was tinsel,
how little of it was real, how much of it was selfishness, and
nothing more.&nbsp; Her heart warmed towards her
benefactor.&nbsp; Confident in her beauty and his goodness of
heart, she feared no harm.&nbsp; In the circle in which she moved
she achieved a complete success.&nbsp; The women were very
envious, and the men were as foolish as most men are where a
pretty woman is concerned.</p>
<p>Young people think little of what is felt for them by their
fathers and mothers.&nbsp; The cynic may say, &lsquo;Why should
they?&nbsp; I did not bring myself into existence; and what has
life done for me but to make me toil for labour that profiteth
not, to clothe me with a carcase that shall soon be dissolved in
death, to give me a mind that utterly, after all its endeavour,
fails to understand even what passes under my very nose, to say
nothing of the mysteries which lie around.&rsquo;&nbsp; But most
of us feel, <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>nevertheless, that our fathers and mothers have claims
on us that we can never sufficiently repay them for&mdash;the
care and love which rocked us in the cradle, which gave joy and
happiness to our early homes, which guarded us in youth, which
helped to plant us out in the world&mdash;a love the memory of
which lasts as long as life.&nbsp; The worst of it is that
frequently we do not feel this till it is too late, till we can
make no ear that it would rejoice to listen to such with rapture
is stilled by the cold hand of death.&nbsp; I can never forget a
picture of a girl weeping at her mother&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; It
was an illustration to one of Jane Taylor&rsquo;s simple poems,
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Oh, if she would but come again,<br />
I think I&rsquo;d vex her so no more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In her new circle Rose had that natural feeling.&nbsp; It was
hard for her to live without her mother.&nbsp; That mother might
be ill; <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>that mother she knew to be lonely and poor, and in need
of her society and aid.&nbsp; It was her duty, she felt, to be by
that mother&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; She intended to return, if not
to-day, at any rate to-morrow; to tell her mother all, how,
notwithstanding appearances, she was innocent as when she slept
under that mother&rsquo;s roof.&nbsp; But the difficulty was to
go back.&nbsp; Her mother would believe her story, but nobody
else would; and all her little world would look at her in
scorn.&nbsp; She could not face that little world that seems to
us so big.&nbsp; What was she to do?&nbsp; Like too many of us in
emergencies, she did nothing, and was overcome by the
circumstances in which she had weakly allowed herself to be
placed.</p>
<p>Yet Rose was not happy in her heart of hearts, and all the
while an inner sense of fear, of something sad and sorrowful to
come, restrained her natural light-heartedness.&nbsp; Scandal had
been busy with her name in her native town.&nbsp; She could not
ask, as she had done in her early days, the blessing of God on
her life.&nbsp; But she had <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>burnt her boats, and for her there
was no return.&nbsp; She was clever, and was determined to
cultivate her powers.&nbsp; All her mornings were spent in hard
study.&nbsp; She had masters who made up for the defects of early
education.&nbsp; The Baronet, who had left London for a while on
a shooting tour in North America, was to return, and, of course,
would marry her in due time; and then her fair fame would be
vindicated, and her mother&rsquo;s heart would beat for
joy.&nbsp; She was a born actress, and her chief delight was to
be found in the study of the leading actors and actresses on the
stage.&nbsp; Her musical talent was of a high order, and she had
a knack of picking up foreign languages that made her the wonder
of the extremely bad set in which she lived.&nbsp; She was always
busy, always in a whirl of excitement, and had little time to
think of what she was and whither she was going.&nbsp; She shrank
from being brought face to face with her real self.&nbsp;
Whenever she did so she found she really had gained but little,
after all.&nbsp; It is true she was not vicious, but, then, she
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>had
grown hard and worldly, and that is little better in the Court of
Conscience.&nbsp; Often she longed for her early home, her
mother&rsquo;s side, her life of daily drudgery, the God of her
early youth.</p>
<p>Very suddenly a change came.&nbsp; Sir Watkin Strahan had left
England, not for a shooting tour in North America, as it had been
understood, but on account of pecuniary embarrassments, brought
on by his extravagant habits.&nbsp; It was hinted that he was
about to marry a fortune, &lsquo;but that matters little,&rsquo;
said the informant to poor Rose; &lsquo;he loves you and you love
him.&nbsp; The hard necessities of his situation will compel him
to go through the form of matrimony with another, but that is no
reason why you two should not be virtually man and
wife.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Baronet said as much in the impassioned
letters which he sent to Rose.&nbsp; He had lost, he regretted to
say, heavily on the turf and at play.&nbsp; He had made some
unfortunate speculations on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; He had
travelled to repair his losses at Homburg, and Baden, and Spa, <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>and there
he had made matters worse.&nbsp; His friends had insisted on his
getting married, promising pecuniary assistance if he did.&nbsp;
They did more.&nbsp; They found out for him a fitting
heiress.&nbsp; A rich merchant had an only daughter whom he was
willing to part with for a consideration&mdash;that she should be
called my lady.&nbsp; As the lady was anxious for a title, and
the gentleman was equally anxious to finger her cash, there was
little reason for delay.&nbsp; Indeed, it was felt on all sides
that the sooner the business was settled the better.&nbsp; The
lady and gentleman had met, and been mutually satisfied with one
another.&nbsp; The Baronet, so proud of his title, had sold
himself for a mess of pottage.&nbsp; That was a very shabby thing
to do; but he did something still shabbier, he implied that to
Rose it would make no difference&mdash;that she would still be
the dearest object to his heart.&nbsp; Poor girl! she felt the
insult bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the way of the world,&rsquo; said her new
friends.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was only what she need expect.&nbsp; She
must have been a fool to <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>think that it would be
otherwise.&rsquo;&nbsp; So said her London friends to her.&nbsp;
Well, she owned she had been a fool.&nbsp; She had never meant to
be a rich man&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; The Baronet had overwhelmed
her with his wealth and magnificence.&nbsp; He had treated her
with such consideration that she never expected anything from him
other than what was right and honourable, and she had been
prepared to give him all she could in return&mdash;her
heart.&nbsp; Further than that she could never go.&nbsp; She
would never be what he wished her to be for all his wealth.&nbsp;
Her dream was over, and she woke to find herself helpless,
friendless, poor, and alone.&nbsp; It was a bitter awakening for
her.&nbsp; It would have broken her heart, and ruined her life,
had it not been for her youthful pluck, and spirit, and
pride.&nbsp; The man of the world who believes woman to be as bad
as himself, who quotes Pope and tells us that every woman is at
heart a rake, will tell me I have drawn an unreal girl.&nbsp; I
tell him there are thousands of such in the homes of the poor,
and it is <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>because there are such that England is still a nation
great and grand.</p>
<p>But to return to our heroine.</p>
<p>When the dishonourable proposal was made to her&mdash;a
proposal which she could not at first understand, veiled as it
was in artful language&mdash;all her pride was in arms, her anger
was aroused, and her love was turned to hate.&nbsp; In her wrath
she left the house, leaving behind her letters, books, jewellery,
dresses, everything that had been given her, and, dressed in the
simple style of her former life, she went out into the world
shedding bitter tears, and not knowing where to go.&nbsp; Sad and
mad, she walked the streets of London alone&mdash;streets in
which it is more dangerous for a pretty girl to walk along, and
at night, than it would be among Kaffir or Hottentots.&nbsp; She
had given no one any intimation of her going, or as to what her
intentions were.&nbsp; She had escaped from the destroyer, that
was enough for her.&nbsp; A stranger to London, she wandered
wearily about, till she came to a street with a blaze of light <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>streaming
from the shop windows on every side, crowded with cabs and
carriages, whilst the pavement was so filled up as to render
locomotion almost impossible.</p>
<p>What she saw struck her with astonishment and horror.&nbsp;
She had never heard of such a thing, and did not believe it
possible.&nbsp; It was night, and yet the place was as busy as if
it were day.&nbsp; There were women in full dress from the
adjacent theatres, other in couples or hanging on the arms of
men, who might have been officers in the army and navy or members
of the swell mob.&nbsp; There were similar parties in hansoms and
broughams.&nbsp; Intermixed with them were beggars, and
pickpockets, and swindlers, and outcasts, and all the riffraff of
a London street.&nbsp; Rose watched the broughams, and saw them
setting down their inmates at a building which bore to her a name
of no meaning.&nbsp; She watched awhile, and then, advancing to
the door and paying her shilling, found herself in a dancing
casino of a rather superior character.&nbsp; The walls were lined
with seats on which men and women <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>were seated.&nbsp; There was a bar
at one end at which a good deal of chaffing and smoking and
drinking were going on.&nbsp; Up in the gallery was a German
band, and, as they played, some danced, while others looked
on.&nbsp; Poor Rose was frightened beyond description at the
appearance of all around her.&nbsp; The air was full of oaths and
laughter, and all were gay, gay as wine could make them, from
Lord Tom Noddy drinking himself into <i>del. trem.</i>, to the
last ticket-of-leave from Her Majesty&rsquo;s jails.&nbsp; Rose
had never seen so many vagabonds collected together under a roof
before, and they were all gay&mdash;the painted harlots, the City
men, the Jew money-lenders, the clerk who had come to spend the
proceeds of his latest embezzlement, the scheming M.P., the
jockey from Newmarket, the prize-fighter from Whitechapel, the
greenhorn from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.&nbsp;
Pulling her veil over her face, Rose stood in a corner by
herself, trembling and alone, afraid to remain, yet afraid to go
away, fearing she might be stopped.&nbsp; <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Already she
found herself remarked on and pointed at; already she had seen in
the crowded and heated room more than one of the boon companions
of her quondam lover.&nbsp; What was she to do?&nbsp; She had
never dreamt of such awful degradation as she saw there.&nbsp;
She had never believed in its existence.&nbsp; She thought such a
place would have never been tolerated by the police, and
impossible in a Christian land.&nbsp; Men jeered at her, as she
stood with the hot blood crimsoning her cheek, while the made-up
women around seemed, to her, grinning over her impending
fall.&nbsp; Was she to become one of them&mdash;to renounce all
modesty and virtue, to drink of the wine-cup offered her on every
side, in the delirium of the hour to enlist in the devil&rsquo;s
service, to put on his livery and to take his pay?&nbsp; Well,
she was poor, but not so poor as all that&mdash;as long as she
had the use of her senses.&nbsp; Better poverty itself than a
life of shame.&nbsp; For awhile she stood dazed and frightened,
forgetting where she was, and that all eyes were upon her.&nbsp;
Presently she was recalled to herself by a gentleman <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>coming up
and asking her to dance.&nbsp; She refused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what the d--- are you here for?&rsquo; was his
rough reply.</p>
<p>She turned away
speechless&mdash;horror-struck&mdash;especially as she saw the
amusement of the half-tipsy bystanders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A deuced fine girl, upon my word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fresh as Hebe,&rsquo; said another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Artfulness itself,&rsquo; was the remark of
another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; that virtuous air is all put on,&rsquo; said one
of the women present.&nbsp; &lsquo;You may depend upon it she is
no better than she should be, although she looks so
shy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; a very promising filly,&rsquo; said the last
speaker&rsquo;s male friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind
to make up to her myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better stay where you are, old man,&rsquo;
replied his female friend, as she gave him a fond caress.</p>
<p>Poor Rose knew by their looks that they were talking at her,
and she trembled from head to foot.&nbsp; Oh that she could hide
herself, that she could get out of the room! but, no, that was
impossible.</p>
<h2><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">UNDER THE STARS.</span></h2>
<p>What could Rose do in that den of wild men and wilder women,
the like of which was to be seen in no other country under
heaven, licensed by Act of Parliament, past which bishops drove
down on their way to make speeches at Exeter Hall on behalf of
the Bible Society, or of the Society for the Propagation of the
Gospel in Foreign Parts?</p>
<p>Again and again she wished she were veil out of that
<i>inferno</i>, where she was stared at on every side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely you will dance, miss,&rsquo; said the master of
the ceremonies, approaching her respectfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Allow
me to introduce you to Lord ---&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Again
Rose declined, much to the annoyance of a debauched, sickly
youth, who was &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo; and reverenced as such
accordingly.&nbsp; My lord revived his spirits with an S. and B.,
and was soon whirling round the room with another in his
arms.</p>
<p>Under the influence of drink a man approached the corner where
Rose was sitting, caught hold of her arm, and with an oath
attempted to drag her off her seat.&nbsp; Her scream brought a
crowd around, but not before her assailant had been knocked down
by a gentleman, who was one of the wall-flowers watching the
dancers, pretending to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>The affrighted proprietor of the place rushed up.&nbsp; If
there was a row he might lose his license.&nbsp; The police were
outside.&nbsp; He brought with him his chuckers-out, and order
was restored.</p>
<p>In the confusion attending its restoration Rose managed to
find her way to the door, her defender walking by her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Outside,&rsquo; she exclaimed joyfully, &lsquo;thank
God!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said her companion, &lsquo;how came
you there?&nbsp; That was not the place for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; she said passionately; &lsquo;I was
wretched and I went in; but,&rsquo; she added,
&lsquo;you&mdash;how came you there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! do you know me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I do.&nbsp; You came to Sloville, and you
made a speech at the Chartist meeting.&nbsp; You were a minister
then, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right,&rsquo; said Wentworth, for it was he;
&lsquo;I was hoping to be a minister then.&nbsp; You may well ask
how I came to be in yon place.&nbsp; Know, then, that I am a
minister no longer&mdash;that illusion is past&mdash;that I am
now a writer for the press and a man about town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am so sorry,&rsquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
thought you made such a good speech at the Chartist meeting, and
hoped that you would do a great deal of good in the town.&nbsp;
Are you happier now than you were then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happier, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&lsquo;Wiser?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, much, and gayer a great deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah then, your experience is something like my
own.&nbsp; We are all alike.&nbsp; As soon as Adam and Eve had
eaten of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil they
ceased to be happy.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe there is such a
thing as happiness in the world.&nbsp; I was so wretched that I
crept in yon den for warmth and shelter, and out of curiosity to
see if that sort of thing was happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that a costermonger&rsquo;s wife has a happier
lot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Foolish soul,&rdquo;&rsquo; continued Wentworth,
&lsquo;&ldquo;what Act of Legislature was there that thou
shouldst be happy?&nbsp; A little while ago thou hadst no right
to be at all.&nbsp; What if thou wert born and predestined not to
be happy, but to be unhappy?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you talking about?&rsquo; said Rose.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You did not speak to the people in that way at
Sloville.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, no!&nbsp; I had not read my Carlyle <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>then.&nbsp;
I am quoting you out of &ldquo;Sartor Resartus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Behold in me a philosopher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Rose, with a smile, &lsquo;I
can&rsquo;t say the sight is particularly brilliant or
overpowering.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment up comes the policeman&mdash;the London
policeman, whose chief occupation seems to be to watch men and
women when they stop in the streets for a talk, and to keep out
of the way when he is wanted to prop up the inebriate, or to lay
hold of a pickpocket, or a burglar, or a rough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must be off,&rsquo; said Wentworth, &lsquo;or we
shall be run in.&nbsp; Which way are you walking?&nbsp; May I see
you home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gradually he was being interested in his companion.&nbsp;
Gradually he began to recall to himself the long-lost vision of
her lovely face.&nbsp; He had never forgotten it, and here, where
he could have least expected, it had come to him once more.&nbsp;
Fate had once more thrown her in his way.&nbsp; Was he to miss
his chance? he asked himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo;
was the reply of the inward <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>monitor; &lsquo;you would be a fool
if you did.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he watched her the light seemed to
fade out of her countenance, and over it came a cloud.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you are tired,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;let
me offer you some refreshment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; I can&rsquo;t eat anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, let me see you home?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The question recalled Rose to herself.&nbsp; She had no
home.&nbsp; She had rushed away in sorrow, and anger, and
despair.&nbsp; In all that wilderness of bricks and mortar she
had no home.&nbsp; She stood there homeless, friendless, and
alone.&nbsp; She hardly felt safe.&nbsp; As they stood talking,
men from the clubs, the theatre and dinner-party passed and
repassed, staring at her impudently all the while.&nbsp; As soon
as Wentworth left her she felt they would seek her, as the lion
does his prey.</p>
<p>At length she said in a saddened tone: &lsquo;I have no
home&mdash;no friends.&nbsp; I know not where to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wentworth was shocked.</p>
<p>And then she told him her story.&nbsp; She <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>felt that
she was safe, that London life had not corrupted him, that there
was a true manhood in him, after all.</p>
<p>There was a quiet hotel just by; he took the poor girl there,
but the landlady objected.&nbsp; They did not take in single
young ladies there who had no luggage, that guarantee of
respectability, and who had no recommendation.&nbsp; Had she been
known to any of the families who had been in the habit of using
her hotel, the case would have been different.&nbsp; As it was
they had not an apartment to spare.</p>
<p>They tried other establishments equally in vain.&nbsp; Rose
began to realize at last all the dangers and horrors of her
situation.&nbsp; There are disadvantages connected with our
refined and highly-developed system of civilization.&nbsp; Out on
the prairie she might have found shelter for the night in the
rude Indian hut, but in Christian London what can a poor girl
do?&nbsp; Is it not a fact that a pretty girl cannot walk down
Regent Street in broad daylight <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>alone without being insulted by some
hoary old debauchee or other?</p>
<p>At length a happy thought came to Wentworth.&nbsp; His
laundress, he knew, let lodgings.&nbsp; She lived in one of the
small streets at the back of Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, and he would
take his charge there for the night.&nbsp; The woman was glad to
oblige him, though she thought it vastly queer; but that was no
concern of hers, or of anyone else, she thought, as long as she
got the rent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Wentworth,&rsquo; she remarked to
her husband as he attempted, as is the manner of men, some
deprecating criticism, &lsquo;is a gentleman, and will behave
himself as such;&rsquo; and she was right, though Wentworth in
town had altered a great deal from the Wentworth of the Sloville
meeting-house: the man seemed not quite so hopeful, not quite so
raw and inexperienced.&nbsp; The laundress had a heart that could
feel for another, and she had connections that could aid
her.&nbsp; By her help Rose was introduced to an establishment
where her services, as a clever hand at dressmaking, were
speedily <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>recognised and in the consciousness that she was
honestly earning her living, and in the daily routine of duty,
she soon forgot the bitterness of her past.&nbsp; She was herself
again, perhaps a trifle more serious, but a good deal more
wise.</p>
<p>Wentworth went down to Sloville, and brought back Rose&rsquo;s
mother, and she was happy and content.&nbsp; The mother could
find no fault with her girl, as she saw how bravely she had
trampled on her past follies, how steadily she worked for her
happiness, and her cup of joy was full.&nbsp; It had almost
killed her when Rose ran away.&nbsp; What she suffered then she
could hardly say, as the dull days and the long nights were spent
in anxious watching and waiting for the well-known step at the
door.&nbsp; Now she could but thankfully say to herself,
&lsquo;This, my precious one, was dead, but is alive again; was
lost, but is found.&rsquo;&nbsp; Happy the father or the mother
who can say as much!</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to Rose to earn her own living; she was a
very clever needle-woman, <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>and got good wages in one of the
grand emporiums of commerce in Regent Street.&nbsp; It was a
pleasure to her to make her mother happy, and they never seemed
as if they could do enough for one another.&nbsp; The mother
never knew why her daughter, of whose beauty she was so proud,
had run away from home, or why she refused to go back to the old
home.&nbsp; Rose was young, and in due time recovered from what,
for the time, was a crushing blow.&nbsp; She heard of the Baronet
occasionally, for his family seat was near Sloville, and her
mother loved to gossip of the place and people.&nbsp; He had
married a rich wife, and paid all his debts.&nbsp; One son had
been the result of the marriage, but that had died in a somewhat
mysterious manner.&nbsp; The lady, whose health was very bad,
chiefly resided at Elm Court, while her lord and master had
returned to his evil courses in town&mdash;as a sow that had been
washed, as the Bible coarsely puts it, to her wallowing in the
mire.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rose never saw anything <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>of him, and
he was nothing to her now.&nbsp; Her mother was a little prying
and inquisitive, but Rose, gentle and tender-hearted, had a way
of keeping her mouth shut&mdash;somewhat rare in her
sex&mdash;and when she had made up her mind to be silent, no
power on earth could make her talk.&nbsp; The old lady got about
her in time some of her old friends, with the male part of whom
the daughter was as popular as ever, in spite of her mysterious
exit from Sloville.</p>
<p>All the young shopmen in the neighbourhood were ready to fall
in love with her, but Rose gave them no encouragement, much to
the grief of her mother, who was really anxious to see her
daughter settled in life.&nbsp; Rose said she was quite
comfortable as she was, and her mother had to give way.&nbsp; It
was soon clearly understood that Rose was not in the matrimonial
market at all, and admiring swains said no more.&nbsp; Rose, as
we have seen, was of gentle birth, and that will assert itself in
the blood.&nbsp; Successful tradesmen <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>have little time to study the graces
of life, and Rose liked refinement; it had come to her
hereditarily, as we all know it does.&nbsp; It was not her fault
that she turned up her nose at vulgar commonplace admirers,
however well off they might be as regards this world&rsquo;s
goods.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that Rose, with her bright face, made
many friends.&nbsp; A leading theatrical, in search of
attractions for his theatre, got hold of her, and found how full
she was of dramatic power.&nbsp; Rose had always been fond of the
stage, even as it appeared in such a humble form as that in which
it was revealed to her at Sloville, and the finished acting of
the London theatre gave her immense satisfaction.&nbsp; At first
the pay was small, and her work was hard; excellence on the
stage, as excellence everywhere, is not to be won without steady
work, but she was an apt learner, and made rapid progress.&nbsp;
One day she had, as all of us have at some time or other, a
chance.&nbsp; One of the principal actresses was taken ill, and
Rose had suddenly to perform her part.&nbsp; <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Her success
was as complete as it was gratifying and unexpected.</p>
<p>As a critic, Wentworth had to record her triumph, and it not a
little astonished him to find in the Miss Howard, the new star of
the theatre, an old acquaintance.&nbsp; The meeting was mutually
gratifying.&nbsp; If in her distress and poverty she needed his
protection, much more did she need it in the hour of her
triumph.&nbsp; If he admired her as a rustic beauty, much more
did he admire her as she shone radiant on the stage.</p>
<p>Since then a couple of years had passed, to both of them
precious ones.&nbsp; It is true they had seen little of each,
other in the meanwhile; when he had walked with her under the
stars from the dancing saloon, he was bent on realizing what
pleasure, if any, is to be found in a life of gaiety and
dissipation.&nbsp; He had fought his doubts and gathered
strength; duty, not pleasure, was to be his aim.&nbsp; The utter
dreary formalism of the old-fashioned Evangelical drove many a
bold lad into dissipation.&nbsp; <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>Youth fancies that sort of thing
attractive, and especially does it come with a tenfold power to
all who have lived in a strict home, and amongst strait-laced
people.&nbsp; The game is hardly worth the candle.&nbsp; Solomon
found it to be so in his time, when he tried the experiment on
the most expensive scale, but youth does not care much for
Solomon, and has over-weening confidence in self.</p>
<p>But Wentworth had seen in the rottenness of the surface
gaiety, in the bitterness of its Dead Sea apples, in the
hideousness of that laughter which is as the crackling of thorns
under a pot, that it was not in that round of drunken revelry
that happiness was to be found, or that man was to be elevated to
his true sphere.&nbsp; The longer he lived in it the more
intolerable it seemed.&nbsp; In his despair he became a cynic and
a pessimist.&nbsp; With what bitterness did he write against
society and the world!&nbsp; It was all out of joint, he said, as
writers of his class ever will, forgetting that it was he who was
out of joint.&nbsp; But one day <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>there came to him a change; he
thought in his wretchedness&mdash;for a man of pleasure is always
wretched&mdash;of the prodigal son.&nbsp; The parable seemed to
have a new meaning for him&mdash;to open his eyes to the fact
that God is a God of love, full of pity for the sinner, ready to
save to the utmost, and that in the person of Jesus Christ we
have a revelation and a realization of Divine love and
power.&nbsp; The call, &lsquo;Come unto Me, all ye that are weary
and heavy-laden,&rsquo; sounded to his ear like that of a
brother.&nbsp; Old Bunyan writes how when Christian escaped out
of the Slough of Despond there came to him a man named Help, who
drew him out.&nbsp; It was the great God Himself to whom
Wentworth owed his escape.&nbsp; As the scales left his eyes, he
saw in the heaven above, not an angry Jehovah, but a God of
love&mdash;a Father, not a Judge.&nbsp; So it was with the great
American preacher Ward Beecher, who, though studying for the
ministry, was for awhile in doubt, in difficulty and
despair.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he writes, &lsquo;when I
stand in Zion and before God, the brightest <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>thing I
shall look back upon will be that blessed morning in May when it
pleased God to reveal to my wondering soul that it was His nature
to love a man in his sins for the sake of helping him out of
them.&nbsp; He did not do it out of compliment to Christ, to a
law or plan of salvation, but from the fulness of His great
heart.&nbsp; That He was not made angry by sin, but sorry; that
He was not furious with wrath toward the sinner, but pitied him;
in short, that He felt toward me as my mother felt toward me, to
whose eyes my wrong-doing brought tears, who never pressed me so
close to her as when I had done wrong, and who would fain with
her yearning heart lift me out of trouble.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the
change was as beautiful as sudden.&nbsp; All earth seemed fresher
to Wentworth, the sun more bright, the earth more green, the
flowers more fair, the songs of birds more musical, and life
infinitely more great and grand.&nbsp; How hard and distasteful
seemed his old idea of religion! how cold and dry and apart from
ordinary life and daily duty!&nbsp; A <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>mere matter of words, a performance
to be carried on on Sunday, and chiefly by unpleasant men and
women who held that the world was a waste, howling wilderness
given over to the devil, and that heaven was only for the elect,
as they deemed themselves to be.&nbsp; They said God would set
aside the laws of nature&mdash;the laws He had made&mdash;and
work miracles on their behalf; that they would prosper and become
fat if they made a profession of religion.&nbsp; It was their
intense selfishness which alienated him.&nbsp; Hell-fire was the
lot of the sinners, and they became religious, not that they had
the least idea of a God of mercy and love, but that they might
not be sent to hell.&nbsp; Their religion was a kind of
fire-escape, that was all.&nbsp; He hated such blasphemy and such
selfishness.&nbsp; When they sang,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lord, what a wretched land this is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That yields us no supplies!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My thoughts on awful subjects roll,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Damnation and the soul;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>or,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lord, we&rsquo;re a garden walled
around,<br />
Planted and made peculiar ground,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he was alike distressed and shocked.</p>
<p>Once upon a time an old divine met Dr. Doddridge, of pious
memory, as he was going to preach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish for you the presence of God in the
chapel,&rsquo; said the good doctor in his unctuous style.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear doctor,&rsquo; said the old divine, &lsquo;we
have always the presence of God everywhere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That was the feeling that came at length to
Wentworth&mdash;that God is everywhere present with us as a
Father and a Friend.&nbsp; It was that that filled his heart with
joy.&nbsp; It was enough for him that he was there to pity and
succour and bless.</p>
<p>It was in a similar spirit that the actress had learned to
realize the Divine presence and power.</p>
<p>And once more they are under the stars as he sees her to her
comfortable home, where an aged mother with a bright smile <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>awaits her
coming.&nbsp; That walk of theirs under the stars had been the
turning-point of their lives.&nbsp; It was the girl trembling and
sorrowful by his side who had helped to recall him to his better
self.&nbsp; She had achieved success, and so had he.&nbsp;
Outcasts as they were in the eyes of the Church, they were
children crying, and not in vain, for the light.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
